Cilan: Chili, are you listening to me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe have to study hard\xfffeand become full-fledged Gym Leaders\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas soon as possible...\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: About that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we had gone to N's Castle a year\xfffeago, the Seven Sages and the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeShadow Triad wouldn't have escaped!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, nobody would say something like\xfffe“Three of you together make..."\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: I guess you're right.\xf000븁\x0000
Cilan: You think so?\xfffeBut it isn't that big of a deal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe may not have made it in time,\xfffebut Team Plasma is still gone.\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: Argh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's because you say things like that.\xfffeThat's why people treat us like a joke!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLike it takes all three of us together\xfffeto make one great Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: You're overthinking it,\xfffebut I can't say the possibility is zero.\xf000븁\x0000
Cilan: Come on, you two...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you think it's a bit strange\xfffeto get recognition and respect as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGym Leaders just for beating bad guys?\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: I understand what you're saying.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if things go on like this,\xfffenothing will ever change.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if we train, the other Gym Leaders\xfffewill become that much stronger as well.\xf000븁\x0000
???: Then...\xfffeWe'll battle you.\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: Based on your appearance,\xfffeyou must be the Shadow Triad.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut why are you here?\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: We came on a whim...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo vent...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo pass time...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt doesn't matter.\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: Three on three!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe first one to beat them\xfffeis the strongest among us!\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: Too easy...\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: These three aren't worth\xfffeworrying about.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe must focus on the other\xfffeGym Leaders so that next time\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey won't get in our way...\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: Well...\xfffeLord Ghetsis is waiting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe must catch that Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: C'mon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat was that?\xfffeCome back here and say that again!\xf000븁\x0000
Cilan: I mean...\xfffeThey were overwhelmingly strong.\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: We have to admit it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe three Leaders of Striaton City\xfffemake one full-fledged Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000
Cilan: You're right.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeChili. Cress.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think as long as the three of us\xfffeact like the Gym Leaders we are now,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffenothing will ever change.\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: I didn't think\xfffeyou would be the first to say that.\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: Of course, I, Cress,\xfffewas thinking about that, too.\xf000븁\x0000
Cilan: All right.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's resign as Gym Leaders\xfffeand start our training over\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom the ground up.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, I'm sure one of us\xfffewill become a Trainer\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeveryone recognizes as great.\xf000븁\x0000
Chili: We're triplets.\xfffeWhat we think is the same.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo we just have to become\xfffeas strong as each other,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand then we can be\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGym Leaders together again!\xf000븁\x0000
Cress: OK. So as for the replacement\xfffeGym Leader...\xf000븁\x0000

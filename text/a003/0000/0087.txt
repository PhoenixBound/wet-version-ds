Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing\xfffeyour Pokémon's innate charm by choosing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffenot to decorate it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHonestly, though, I think using Props\xfffewould be better received in this musical.\xf000븁\x0000
Now, now. Don't be like that.\xfffePlease reconsider and select a Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!\xf000븁\x0000

Happy birthday!\xfffeI've got this festive Prop to give you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a cake from me, the owner!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, this is a Prop, so you should\xfffeattach it to your Pokémon and not eat it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, even if today isn't your\xfffebirthday, I won't take it back!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy?\xfffeBecause I'm the owner!\xf000븁\x0000
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous\xfffethan ever before, so I'm researching the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestyles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up\xfffethere today!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOverall, totally \xf000ģ\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe \xf000ģ\x0001\x0001 Prop\xfffewas a great accent.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI noticed that your \xf000ģ\x0001\x0002\xfffefactor was a bit subdued today.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the\xfffeshow you're performing in is im-por-tant!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf it's a good match, you can win the\xfffehearts of the audience!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou'll be sure to attract attention.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're going to get on stage,\xfffeit's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image:\xfffecool, cute, elegant, or quirky.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBefore you play Dress Up, take a moment\xfffeto think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're\xffferather rich.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you say rich people, you think\xfffemusical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have\xfffeplayed Dress Up with their Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful!\xfffeI'm always watching them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope you can keep entertaining us with\xfffeyour performances.
I always make sure to watch the\xfffeshows you participate in!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven from the perspective of a rich\xfffeman like me, the Pokémon Musical\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis impressive!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from\xfffelast time!\xf000븁\x0000
You can hang Musical Photos from your\xfffeprevious shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon,\xfffemy eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this\xfffeMusical Theater.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOne time, a Pokémon wandered up on\xfffestage and started imitating the actors.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverybody thought it was sensational!\xfffeTa-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people\xfffewill become your fans and give you Props.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't have any Props, so I'll give you\xfffethis instead!\xf000븁\x0000
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is\xfffeboosted more and more if it's used\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeevery turn.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHaving a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep\xfffeparticipating in the musical, and keep\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeusing Echoed Voice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou'll make more fans in the musical, and\xfffeyou'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!

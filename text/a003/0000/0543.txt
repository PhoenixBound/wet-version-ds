Cheren: Oh, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xfffeCan you come with me for a moment?\xf000븁\x0000
Kawbraa!
Rood: That Pokémon...?\xf000븁\x0000
Elderly Man: It's the legendary Pokémon\xfffecalled Cobalion!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI told you the story the other\xfffeday, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Oh, Cobalion!\xfffeWhat a noble presence!\xf000븁\x0000
Elderly Man: They say the three Pokémon\xfffeCobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefought against people to protect\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon from the war those\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepeople started...\xf000븁\x0000
When people fight, there's no peace for\xfffePokémon, either.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe three legends learned that\xfffethe deeds of humans could lead\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto dire consequences for their world.\xf000븁\x0000
But... Why did it show up\xfffein front of people?\xf000븁\x0000
Is it patrolling the Unova region\xfffeto protect Pokémon because it fears for\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetheir safety after the commotion caused\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby Team Plasma two years ago?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr does it sense a new problem...?\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Unforgivable...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo the reach of Ghetsis's ambition\xfffeand malice is growing ever wider and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewarping the lives of all it touches...\xf000븁\x0000
Did Cobalion appear in front of you\xfffemerely by accident?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr to plead with you to solve a problem?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUnlike Lord N, I don't have the ability\xfffeto understand the minds of Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTherefore, I don't know\xfffewhat that Pokémon is thinking.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if you can befriend Cobalion,\xfffeit will be a great asset to you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon your journey.
Not just people and Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's best for all creatures to accept\xfffeand trust one another...
Chargestone Cave is great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Ferroseed I met here\xfffewere absolutely adorable!

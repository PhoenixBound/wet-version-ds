As they wandered in search of Pokémon,\xfffepeople began making homes in more places.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis ranch used to be a grassy meadow.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's now become a place where people\xfffeand Pokémon have homes together!
I don't really know much about\xfffePokémon types and stuff like that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI just focus on raising one Pokémon\xfffeand charge ahead!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut it's kinda the hard way to do things.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen I run into a Pokémon that mine is\xfffenot good against, I can't win anymore!
Oh, you have so many Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSeems to me that thinking about how\xfffeto raise each one would be a lot of fun!
Yip!

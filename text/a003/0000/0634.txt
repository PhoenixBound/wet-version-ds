Playing the piano isn't much fun lately...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe what I need is to hear a cry\xfffewith a wonderful melody.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat might get my imagination going.\xf000븁\x0000
Do you know about this?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Pokémon called Kricketot has a cry\xfffethat sounds like an instrument!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'd sure like to hear it sometime.
The cry of that Kricketot with you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDedelee dun dun dun dum! ♪\xfffeIt sounds just like a xylophone!\xf000븁\x0000
One more thing...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I could hear just one more cry,\xfffemy heart would flutter and my fingers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewould dance over the keys!
I hear a Pokémon called Whismur\xfffehas a very quiet cry.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I knew what it sounded like,\xfffeI could play perfect pianissimo!
The cry of that Whismur with you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's wonderfully pianissimo!\xfffeIt reverberates like a sweet murmur!
Thanks to you and your Pokémon,\xfffemy mind is overflowing with melodies!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can play the piano again!\xf000븁\x0000
This is a token of my appreciation for\xfffeyour getting me out of my slump. Thanks!
Shall I play a song I like for you?
Hee hee!\xfffeListen closely, then!
Alas. That's unfortunate...\xfffeIf you change your mind, let me know!
She's absorbed in her performance!
Do you want to listen to my drum?
My! Heart!\xfffeAs long as my heart beats!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will keep! On! Drumming!!

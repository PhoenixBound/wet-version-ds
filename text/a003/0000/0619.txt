I knew it!\xfffeYou look just like her!\xf000븁\x0000
Come now! Don't say that!\xfffeMy eyes are actually quite sharp!\xf000븁\x0000
I know your mom!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI met her when she was working\xfffeat the Pokémon Center\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand I was a Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! How are your Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're always welcome to let\xfffethem rest here!

No news is good news they say.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing happy about something\xfffelike that is a little difficult though.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing a parent is tough.
Maybe I should go on a journey\xfffeto go find my child!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, but I would feel really bad\xfffeif they stopped by while I was gone.
I sure wish you two could meet!

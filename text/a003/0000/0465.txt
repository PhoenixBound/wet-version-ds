Skyla: A PR makeover?\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: That's right!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere's the thing. I make what everyone\xfffethinks is cool into a reality, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, I get to do what I want to do,\xfffeand while being a model may be difficult,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemost importantly, it's fun!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the hard parts are really hard.\xfffeI mean, everyone judges me\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesimply based on my appearance.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople say that I'm reserved,\xfffeand that I don't look like the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetype who would tell jokes!\xf000븁\x0000
...
Elesa: So, I've been thinking about\xfffeit constantly since then!\xf000븁\x0000
A sophisticated joke!\xf000븁\x0000
How should I put it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy looks suggest that\xfffeI'm not a lot of fun.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I'll tear down that mistaken\xfffeimage with my own hands!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll say something silly and give someone\xfffean opportunity to call me out,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso we can all have a good laugh!\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Uh... OK...\xf000븁\x0000

Elesa: You bought those Fossils from\xfffeClay? Did you buy them on Clay-away?\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Elesa...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThose are just a bunch of bad puns.\xfffeWhere's the joke?\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: Exactly! If I make bad puns when\xfffeI'm supposed to be telling a joke,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedoesn't it give people even more\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof an opportunity to tease me\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand start a funny back-and-forth?\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Um...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's a little too sophisticated for me.\xfffeActually, it's really hard to understand.\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: Really?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess I'll just rethink\xfffemy fashion first.\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Sounds good!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey, as long as we're hanging out,\xfffesurely you wouldn't mind having\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea Pokémon battle with me, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: You bet!\xfffeAnd don't call me Shirley!\xf000븁\x0000

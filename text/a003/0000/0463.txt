Iris: Yay! I did it!\xfffeHaxorus, thank you!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI won because of you!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Well done, Iris.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: What did you want\xfffeto talk to me about, Grandpa?\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Ah yes...\xfffeI was thinking about the past.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI traveled all over the world\xfffelooking for a successor.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI even went to remote places\xfffesuch as the Village of Dragons.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's where I met you, Iris.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Yep!\xfffeI was the strongest!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Yes.\xfffeI was surprised.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou were one with your Pokémon\xfffeand battling with so much joy.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJust watching you made me smile.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour opponents felt disappointed by\xfffetheir defeat, but at the same time\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey enjoyed the battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was completely natural for me\xfffeto decide I wanted to make you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy successor.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: I'm so glad I came to Unova!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are many different people\xfffeand so many different Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd you know what...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn the Village of Dragons, people take\xfffeliving alongside Pokémon for granted.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was surprised some people\xfffein Unova didn't think that way!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: I found your reactions\xfffeto be a breath of fresh air.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd as a condition to leave the\xfffeVillage of Dragons, you wanted\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto broaden your experiences\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand become the Champion...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo as I promised,\xfffeI've been training you as a Trainer\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand as a Gym Leader.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAn order directly from Alder\xfffecame as I was training you.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Alder was smiling, though.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: He lost to N\xfffeand retrained himself.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe asked me to help him with his special\xfffetraining, but it was ghastly.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe wanted to become an immense\xfffeobstacle for you, the new Champion...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor that alone, he pushed himself\xfffeincredibly hard.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Alder was really, really strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd even when I felt a bit weak,\xfffehe encouraged us!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe said that even when their backs\xfffeare against the wall, my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave an intense look in their eyes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, that's why I won, but I feel\xfffelike I still have a lot to learn.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Don't forget that feeling.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd now, if I may change the subject...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you came to Opelucid City,\xfffeI gave you those clothes, right?\xf000븁\x0000
You're the Champion, now.\xfffeIt's all right to dress up a little.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Are these new clothes?\xfffeOK. I'll change into them right now!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Wooow!\xfffeIt's such a flowing dress!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: What is important is\xfffeyour mental preparation\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas the Champion, Iris.\xf000븁\x0000
When I was little,\xfffePoké Balls didn't exist yet.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes Pokémon would run away\xfffefrom awful Trainers who didn't try\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto understand them.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: But you were fine, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can tell!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour Haxorus loves you very much!\xf000븁\x0000
I've already decided!\xfffeI know what kind of Champion I will be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's a myth in Sinnoh that says\xfffethe reason why Pokémon jump out\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis because they want to thank people.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure that we and Pokémon have helped\xfffeeach other and enriched the world\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesince ancient times.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThese memories have been engraved in\xfffeeach Pokémon's heart!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, I want Pokémon and people\xfffeto get closer and closer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs the Champion,\xfffeI want to tell that to everybody!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Good!\xfffeIf anyone can do it, you can.\xf000븁\x0000

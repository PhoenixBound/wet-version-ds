Clay: Here we are!\xf000븁\x0000
Whaddya think?\xfffeGreat buildin', huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere's where the Pokémon World\xfffeTournament takes place!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAin't she purty?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFollow me, tads!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: I barely recognized\xfffeyou and \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou two are way different from when\xfffewe battled in Aspertia City!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTraveling with Pokémon makes\xfffeeveryone grow so much...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What was that just now?!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going after him!\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, come with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Stop.\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: There's no reason\xfffefor you to stick your necks into\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesomething so dangerous!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: The Pokémon I'm looking\xfffefor--my little sister's Purrloin--it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemight be with them!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'm going, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've got his back!\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: I don't understand.\xfffeThat's not courage, it's recklessness!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes he think anything is possible simply\xfffebecause he has Pokémon with him?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo, no...\xfffeThat's not possible.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll Trainers and Pokémon are bound\xfffeto one another by Poké Balls...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen maybe it is this bond that will allow\xfffeTrainers to overcome the impossible if\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey trust their partner Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: Trust...\xfffeIt's too much of an unknown factor.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if believing in your Pokémon\xfffegives you the courage to stand up\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto Team Plasma...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd the courage to help your friends...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen follow them south to the dock!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: The Shadow Triad?\xfffeWhat's their deal, anyway!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAAAAH!\xfffeTeam Plasma! Where did you vanish to!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: The Shadow Triad...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith their superhuman powers, they\xfffecan immobilize people and then disappear!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I'm more concerned with what\xfffeZinzolin said...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“Once again, we will use the\xfffelegendary Dragon-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand we will rule the Unova region!"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat could that mean?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe legendary Dragon-type Pokémon\xfffeReshiram and Zekrom\xf000븀\x0000\xfffearen't in Unova anymore...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's something I want to look into,\xfffeso I'm going to head to Route 6!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBe careful out there!\xf000븁\x0000
A helmet is an important tool for\xfffeshock protection!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's good to let your Pokémon\xfffehave one, too!\xf000븁\x0000
If you let a Pokémon hold a Rocky Helmet,\xfffethe foe will also be damaged if that foe's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemove makes physical contact.
       
Water Pledge,\xfffeFire Pledge,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Grass Pledge.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen combinations of these\xfffethree moves are used in battle,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffespecial things happen!
       
       
       
My husband can teach some Pokémon the\xfffeultimate moves!

What kind of Trainers will come?\xfffeWhat kind of battle will it be?
When battling in front of people,\xfffeit's well known that you should stand\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour ground and not dance around.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I can't resist moves that groove,\xfffelike Petal Dance, Quiver Dance,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFiery Dance, and Dragon Dance.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd on rare occasions, even Lunar Dance!
The crowd will go wild for my Pokémon!
Isn't it wonderful how people\xfffechallenging themselves helps\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebring the world together!
When a Pokémon learns the move\xfffeHidden Power, somehow I can tell\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat type that move will be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeShould I tell you what type of\xfffeHidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power,\xfffeI can tell you what type of Hidden Power\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour Pokémon will learn!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo you want to know?
If this Pokémon were to learn\xfffeHidden Power, the move's type\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewould be \xf000ă\x0001\x0000!
The type of this Pokémon's\xfffeHidden Power is \xf000ă\x0001\x0000!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll\xfffeactivate my hidden power for you!
It's not possible for an Egg to use\xfffeHidden Power!
I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn\xfffeto use Hidden Power.
That cave down there\xfffeis the Relic Passage!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was recently discovered,\xfffebut amazingly, it's...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWait? Where was it\xfffeconnected to again?
A ship's only really a ship when\xfffeit's crossing an ocean.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDocked ships sure look lonely.

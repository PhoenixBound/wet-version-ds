Working at this complex\xfffewas my dream...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut now that it's come true,\xfffeI've got everything I want...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat? The foreman said so? OK, fine.\xfffeWe just have to battle, right?\xf000븁\x0000
I came to this complex so\xfffemy Pokémon could accomplish a lot!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means that as a Trainer,\xfffeI have to work like crazy!

I'm happy just to be with\xfffemy awesome Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat? A battle?\xfffeI guess so... I'll play a bit.\xf000븁\x0000
I completely forgot!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I don't work really hard, my Pokémon\xfffewon't have a chance to shine!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll riiight! Time to get to work!

Every day is the same...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI get bored when things don't change,\xfffeso I don't mind battling you!\xf000븁\x0000
It's OK if every day's the same\xfffewhen I'm working at this complex!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt means there aren't any problems!
Heating crude oil separates\xfffeit into many different components...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's what this distillation tower is for!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's also known as a topper,\xfffebut I want to call it a distillation tower.
Oh! My knowledge overflowed,\xfffeand it was overheard!
The smokestacks of the complex\xffferise up into the sky.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat powerful silhouette\xfffeis sure breathtaking, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, they're burning up\xfffewaste gas.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRecently, they've found all sorts\xfffeof uses for this gas, though.
Oh! You overheard some\xfffeof my vast stock of knowledge!
Those gas holders are sure an\xfffeexpression of harmony, aren't they?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's a reason behind that shape.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA sphere is best for withstanding\xfffethe tremendous pressure inside.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt would be nice if they would draw\xfffea Pokémon on these gas holders, too.
Oh! You overheard some\xfffeof my breathtaking knowledge.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you actually...interested\xfffein what I have to say?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat would mean I have\xfffea complex buddy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat makes me really happy!\xfffeWell then, take this with you!

Oh my! Why, you have a\xfffePokédex, don't you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard that the newest Pokédex\xfffehas an amazing function called\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Habitat List!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould you use it to show me what kind\xfffeof Pokémon live in this complex?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh? You don't have the\xfffeHabitat List for the complex\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefilled up yet...

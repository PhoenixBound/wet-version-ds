Gwa ha ha!\xfffeEven though you're just a fledgling,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou'll still be my 1,000th win in a row!\xf000븁\x0000
I understand. I've got a 999-win streak!\xfffeIt's natural to be intimidated.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I can't let you go further\xfffeunless you battle me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd there's definitely no way around me.\xfffeNope. You shouldn't use Surf\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto cross the river, for example.
I've steadily extended my win streak\xfffefor two years... And now it's over...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I have a strong will.\xfffeI declare that I'll try again\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto have a 1,000-win streak!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI won't battle you next time, though.\xfffeYou'll just break my streak.

\xf000븉\x0001\x0002But... You don't have Fresh Water...\xfffeI appreciate the thought, though...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0002Thank...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat?\xfffeOh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWithout Fresh Water...\xfffeI can't run on bridges anymore.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000

Aickman: How about this? This sound!\xfffeDoesn't it get to your heart? Your mind?

Koontz: Oh, you want to listen to my song\xfffeafter all! Yes!

Keep somebody's secret.\xfffeOtherwise, your secret will be out.
I tried to ask for directions, but\xfffeit turned out I was talking to a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need to be careful, too.

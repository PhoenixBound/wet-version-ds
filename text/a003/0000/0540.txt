Hey, Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThese boulders suddenly\xfffelined up like this...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's more, the HM Strength\xfffewon't budge them.
I never would have guessed\xfffethey were Crustle...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're interested in Crustle,\xfffeyou'll find them in the Desert Resort,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhich is just past here!
It's a big boulder, but it doesn't\xfffelook like a Pokémon can move it...
Colress: I've been waiting for you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's the matter?\xfffeInterested in what's behind me?\xf000븁\x0000
These are not mere rocks, but\xfffethe Pokémon known as Crustle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeObserve.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith this device I created\xfffeto energize Pokémon, I'll...\xf000븁\x0000
      
Colress: Those Crustle...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWere they just lying here,\xfffeout of energy, with their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeboulders on their backs?\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma said we should recognize\xfffethe potential in Pokémon and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeliberate them from humans.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI disagree.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeConversely, it should be humans who bring\xfffeout the hidden potential in Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Now that I think of it,\xfffeI never asked your name.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xfffeI'll remember that name.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, I will test you to see if\xfffeyou're a Trainer who can bring out\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe hidden potential of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: I see! Just like the\xfffeGym Leaders in each area or the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeElite Four and Champion in the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon League, you bring out the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepower in Pokémon by being kind to them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the kind of person you are.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm extremely grateful for your help.\xfffeThis is a token of my gratitude.\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: It's so frustrating!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf only we could talk to Pokémon\xfffein order to bring out their power!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut there's no way a person\xfffelike that could ever exist!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeI hope to see you again sometime.\xf000븁\x0000
Ra ra ra ra!
Braviary flew off into the sky...
All I do is look at the cars\xfffedriving down the freeway.
When the ruins were discovered,\xfffenew construction was stopped...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGuess you can't compete\xfffeagainst the weight of history.
Oh! Trainer, take a look at the sand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you see how some areas are lighter?\xfffeAnd some of the sand looks...darker...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon are hiding in the darker sand!

Trainer Tips!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xfffePokémon have a source of energy\xfffefor using moves.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's called PP, meaning Power Points.\xfffeThey have PP for each move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen a move has no PP remaining,\xfffethat Pokémon cannot use that move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's a good time to head for\xfffethe Pokémon Center!

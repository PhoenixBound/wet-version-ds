Iris: Yahoo! I haven't seen you since\xfffeI ran into you in Castelia City!\xf000븁\x0000
Are you here to battle Grandpa?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYep! Opelucid City's Gym Leader,\xfffeDrayden, is my grandpa.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're not really related, though!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! The Gym is that way!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBefore challenging it,\xfffeyou might want to go to Route 9!\xf000븁\x0000
Still, your Pokémon really respect you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel how much fun your Pokémon are\xfffehaving, even from inside their Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGood luck!\xf000븁\x0000
Still, your Pokémon really respect you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel how much fun they're having,\xfffeeven from inside their Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGood luck!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: I'll show you the way.\xfffeFollow me.\xf000븁\x0000
This way.\xf000븁\x0000
We're here.\xfffeOK! Come inside.\xf000븁\x0000
What was that?\xf000븁\x0000
This world of ice...\xf000븁\x0000
Haxorus!\xfffeUse Dragon Tail!\xf000븁\x0000
Rarh raaaah!
That's enough, Haxorus!\xf000븁\x0000
Not only did the ice stay unbroken,\xfffethere's not even a scratch on it!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat's going on?\xf000븁\x0000
???: I don't think that's going to work.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: I remember you from N's Castle.\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: It's bitter cold.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm shivering.\xfffeI'm suffering, but I'm alive!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's what the essence of life feels like!\xfffeIt's proof of my existence!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut that's enough of philosophy.\xfffeHere are the facts for your admiration:\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis ice was specially created by\xfffeTeam Plasma's technology.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs long as we have our secret weapon,\xfffeyou'll never be able\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto melt or break this ice!\xf000븁\x0000
Let me explain our purpose here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDrayden, hand over the DNA Splicers!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOpelucid City is a city where the\xfffepast and the future are entwined.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould there be a more perfect place\xfffefor the splicers that connect the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeseparated Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Do you think someone\xfffewho knows what you did two years\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeago will just hand them over quietly?\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Humph.\xfffeThat's what I thought you'd say.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt this point, I'd like to threaten\xfffeyou with another volley of ice,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut we can't use it for a moment...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSigh. It won't be enjoyable in this cold,\xfffebut I guess we'll just search for them.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Those foul villains!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeI want you to help me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're going to drive Team Plasma\xfffeout of Opelucid City!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Pokémon are pawns!\xfffeThey're a means to an end.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what I was taught!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't think about it too much.\xfffeIt's easier that way!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: How can this be?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs that the kind of power Pokémon have\xfffewhen they're not treated like objects?
Team Plasma: The others were saying\xfffethat the only place we haven't yet\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesearched is the Pokémon Gym!
Team Plasma: This time, we'll take over\xfffethe Unova region!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou! You're trembling already?\xfffeFrom fear or from cold--either's good!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: It's not over!\xfffeThe others will find the DNA Splicers!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhen they do, the Unova region is ours!
Team Plasma: Now that you mention it,\xfffeI think I might have been ordered\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto comb the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: Don't get in our way!\xfffeYou bother!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBother, bother, bother!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: How humiliating...\xfffeBeing bothered by a bother...
Team Plasma: Zinzolin said to stick to\xfffeDrayden, because that's where we'll\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefind anything important!
Team Plasma: I lost.\xfffeI didn't stand a chance...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't believe Haxorus blasted me\xfffeall the way over here!
Team Plasma: I think Zinzolin was going\xfffeto check the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: I've been nursing a\xfffegrudge for two years, old man.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Even if this is the first time\xfffeI've battled you!
Drayden: They're getting tougher!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeTake care of the others!
Drayden: The only one left is\xfffeZinzolin of the Seven Sages!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhere could he be?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh!\xfffeWhat's going on at the Pokémon Gym?!
Team Plasma: That old guy won't hold\xfffeback even if his opponent is a young girl.
Team Plasma: Oh, that Drayden!\xfffeWhere did he hide the DNA Splicers?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSomewhere familiar and common, right?
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI didn't expect to have to fight\xfffehampered by cold like this.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, no matter! The fact that I'm\xfffeshivering means I'm truly alive!\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: You're a strong Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou definitely are adept\xfffeat handling Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI believe I'll take my leave, simply\xfffebecause I can't stand this cold.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut...imagine this...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Unova region...completely...covered...\xfffein...ice.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo achieve that splendor,\xfffewe'll do whatever it takes\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto obtain the DNA Splicers.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: You're even better than I\xfffehoped. Thanks to you, we drove them off.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm grateful to your Pokémon, also.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAfter all that, the least I can do\xfffeis heal them with this medicine.\xf000븁\x0000
Wait here a moment.\xfffeI'll be right back.\xf000븁\x0000
Harrumph...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's a new record for\xfffemaking it there and back.\xf000븁\x0000
Look, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xfffeThese are the DNA Splicers!\xf000븁\x0000
This is what they were after!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're really fortunate Team Plasma\xfffedidn't get their hands on them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know what their goal is, but I'm\xfffesure they're planning something wicked.\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: As we suspected...\xfffeThe hiding place was in the Gym.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell thought out.\xfffeIf Drayden isn't there, we can't get in.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf he is there, he's the strongest\xfffeguard we could possibly face.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt also explains why the\xfffePokémon Gym was remodeled.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhatever.\xfffeThe DNA Splicers are in our hands now.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: It's beyond my imagination to\xfffethink you'd use one of the Seven Sages\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto find out where the splicers were!\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: Now you know, then.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe will accomplish our goals,\xfffeno matter what the cost.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe don't have the ability to captivate\xfffethe hearts of others like Lord N does.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeInstead, we will bend people\xfffeto our will with brute force.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTwo years was a surprisingly long wait.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: If they've been stolen from us,\xfffewe'll just have to take them back!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: They don't seem to be in\xfffethis area. However, they can hide their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepresence, so be on guard as you look!
Shadow Triad: Heh heh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou don't really think you can take\xfffethe DNA Splicers back, do you?\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: Awww. How unlucky.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't happen to be the one\xfffeholding the DNA Splicers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was just buying time\xfffefor the others to escape.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCheerio, bye-bye, whatever.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Oh no! Ah! No!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo, no, it's not your fault, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xfffeYou were impressive!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's me who's let everybody down.\xf000븁\x0000
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 picked up the Xtransceiver.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Augh!\xfffeIf there were only two of me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen I could protect the town\xfffeand chase after them, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xfffeDrayden, glad to see you're safe as well.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Hello, Cheren.\xfffeYou have certainly grown.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hear you filled in for Lenora by\xfffebecoming the Gym Leader in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAspertia City.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Thanks.\xfffeWe should save catching up for later.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have a good idea of where\xfffeTeam Plasma is hiding.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe place with the lowest temperature\xfffein the Unova region right now is\xf000븀\x0000\xfffean area close to Humilau City.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDrayden, please protect Opelucid City.\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 and I will find Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Very well.\xfffeI'll do my part--and thanks.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe chase I'll leave to you!\xfffeBut...don't do anything reckless.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeI could use your help, if you're willing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're a skilled Trainer who can go\xfffetoe-to-toe with Team Plasma.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's my definition of useful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDrayden, we're off!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Humilau City, huh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs there anything to the\xfffenorth of Undella Town?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, protect Pokémon\xfffefrom Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll people should think for themselves\xfffeabout the nature of the relationship\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebetween people and Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's not something Team Plasma gets\xfffeto decide for everyone!
Drayden: Little by little,\xfffethe ice is starting to melt.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's all thanks to you.\xfffeAs a fellow Trainer, I heartily thank you!
Why do Pokémon stay by our sides?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we could talk to them, we could ask.\xfffeI'm a bit scared about what they'd say.
The memories of everyone who has lived\xfffein this city have built up over the years\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewithout changing much.
This city changes endlessly.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd every change is engraved in the\xfffememories of the people who live here.
I reached heights I never could\xfffehave arrived at because I had\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon by my side.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I believe my Pokémon became\xfffetough because they were with me!
I think some things shouldn't be\xfffechanged, even if it's inconvenient.
I think some things must be changed\xfffeno matter how much you love them!
A person called N had the\xfffelegendary Pokémon with him,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut was he really the hero?
A world of ice.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch beauty goes beyond old and new--\xfffeinspirational, yet terrifying.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThough, to me, there's a comfort in\xfffeold things that you can't find in the new.
A world of ice.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch beauty goes beyond new and old--\xfffeinspirational, yet terrifying.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThough, to me, there's a coolness to new\xfffethings that I prize more than the old.
Gym Leader Drayden leads\xfffeOpelucid City as its mayor!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe's always training by wrestling\xfffewith his Pokémon.
My Pokémon show me affection,\xfffeso I'm not lonely!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I return their affection even more!
There was a group that told\xfffepeople to release their Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey were great big liars, but it\xfffecreated a good opportunity to think.
After that speech, my Pokémon\xfffeand I have been thinking about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat's true for us.
After that speech, I've been thinking\xfffeabout the ideal relationship for me and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy Pokémon as we move forward together.
Unova's symbols are\xfffeZekrom and Reshiram,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut I wonder where they are now.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre they passing along their\xfffeancient knowledge to someone?
Pursuing ideals is different from person\xfffeto person and Pokémon to Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn this city, it seems the ideal is\xfffeto cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different\xfffefrom person to person and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon to Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn this city, it seems the truth is\xfffeconstant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put\xfffeinto this melody...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody...\xfffeI will send them to the future.
I was just reminded of Iris.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, the Champion.\xfffeThat Iris...\xf000븁\x0000
I wonder what kind of\xfffeChampion she'll become.

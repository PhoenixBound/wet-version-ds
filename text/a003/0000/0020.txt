I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon,\xfffe'cause they're my favorites!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey don't do well against Water-, Rock-,\xfffeor Ground-type Pokémon and moves.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut thinking about how to compensate\xfffefor that is one of the fun things\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeabout being a Trainer.
Sometimes I look through my PC Box and\xfffepick out an interesting Pokémon to raise!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are so many things you never\xfffeknow until you raise a certain Pokémon.
Skreee!
Fwee-oosh!

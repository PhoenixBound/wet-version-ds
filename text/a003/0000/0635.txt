Professor Juniper: Hi there, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Hee hee!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI used Fly, so it looks like\xfffeI beat you here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks for your help\xfffein Reversal Mountain!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: If you go straight\xfffepast Lacunosa Town, you'll reach\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOpelucid City!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut before you go, there's something\xfffeI want you two to hear.\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: What is it?\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: You'll know soon\xfffeenough. Hurry now!\xf000븁\x0000
You must be the ones who want to hear\xfffethat old tale about Lacunosa Town.
Professor Juniper: That's right.\xfffePlease tell us.\xf000븁\x0000
All right, my dearies.\xfffePlease come in.\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: This is the place!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Wasn't that\xfffean interesting folktale?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon's true identity may be\xfffeunknown, but the power mentioned\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the story is incredible!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: I know...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe power to freeze everything around it\xfffecould even rival the power of the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelegendary Dragon-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, Bianca.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's almost like Zekrom, who scorched\xfffeUnova with intense lightning long ago.\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, Bianca.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's almost like Reshiram, who scorched\xfffeUnova with blazing fire long ago.\xf000븁\x0000
By the way, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffedo you remember the story of Zekrom?
By the way, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffedo you remember the story of Reshiram?
I told you a little about it in\xfffeLentimas Town, remember?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeZekrom is a legendary Dragon-type\xfffePokémon that lends its power to the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeperson it recognizes as a hero\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepursuing ideals.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt has a black body, and it can\xfffeunleash fearsome lightning!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI even told you a little about\xfffeit in Lentimas Town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeZekrom is a legendary Dragon-type\xfffePokémon that lends its power to the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeperson it recognizes as a hero\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepursuing ideals.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt has a black body, and it can\xfffeunleash fearsome lightning!\xf000븁\x0000
So you remember I told you a little\xfffeabout it in Lentimas Town!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeReshiram is a legendary Dragon-type\xfffePokémon that lends its power to the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeperson it recognizes as a hero who\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeseeks truth.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt has a white body, and it can send\xfffeforth ferocious flames!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI even told you a little about\xfffeit in Lentimas Town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeReshiram is a legendary Dragon-type\xfffePokémon that lends its power to the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeperson it recognizes as a hero who\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeseeks truth.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt has a white body, and it can send\xfffeforth ferocious flames!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Professor, do you think\xfffethere's a connection between\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Pokémon from the old story\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: The meteorite.\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: The meteorite?\xf000븁\x0000
Zekrom was revived from a\xffferock called the Dark Stone.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's suppose the meteorite\xfffefrom the story and this stone\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeare one and the same...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTake into account that elements\xfffefrom the same era were found in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDragonspiral Tower, where Zekrom was,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand in the Giant Chasm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt doesn't prove anything, but it\xfffecould be a piece of the puzzle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's not write it off as a\xfffecoincidence just yet...\xf000븁\x0000
Reshiram was revived from a\xffferock called the Light Stone.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's suppose the meteorite\xfffefrom the story and this stone\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeare one and the same...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTake into account that elements\xfffefrom the same era were found in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDragonspiral Tower, where Reshiram was,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand in the Giant Chasm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt doesn't prove anything, but it\xfffecould be a piece of the puzzle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's not write it off as a\xfffecoincidence just yet...\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: If your theories are true,\xfffeit should be a really strong Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat kind of a reason would there be\xfffefor it to come out only at night?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLike, if, like, it doesn't like sunlight\xfffeor something like that...\xf000븁\x0000
Until we look into it more deeply, it would\xfffebe hard to say anything about that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow that I think about it, the name\xfffe“Lacunosa" could be derived from\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelacunosus clouds, which are clouds\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat resemble a net or a fence.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder if the name is related to\xfffethe part of the story where they\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebuilt walls to protect the town\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom that Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Sorry, I rambled on a bit, didn't I?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, could you ask Drayden\xfffeabout this, if you get a chance?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to do a little fieldwork.\xfffeBianca, help out, OK!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Sure thing!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, just so you know, Opelucid City's\xfffemayor, Drayden, wrestles with his\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon to toughen them up!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper, wait up!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's up?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave you seen Team Plasma\xfffeanywhere around here?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI heard a rumor to that effect...\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud...\xfffeThis is troublesome indeed,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy curious Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps I should satiate\xfffeyour curiosity somewhat.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe reason I am still part\xfffeof Team Plasma is this:\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to know how the world will change.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeListen. Pokémon are nature.\xfffePoké Balls are civilization.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHumans who are used to civilization\xfffedon't relinquish it easily.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, both nature and\xfffecivilization are important.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut what will happen to a world\xfffetaken over by Team Plasma?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople will be forced to throw out\xfffePoké Balls--a product of civilization.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to know what that looks like!\xfffeAnd I want to enjoy it!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Shut your mouth.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll I want is to get back\xfffea stolen Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000! Give me a hand!\xfffeYou ready?
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Just to let you know...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're about to feel my rage!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Got it!\xfffeGo get ready and then come back here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing careful against opponents\xfffelike these isn't a bad thing!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Are you ready to pitch in?\xfffeOK, let's go!
Team Plasma: What's with these two?\xfffeI'm battling alongside Zinzolin!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis shouldn't be happening!\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: These Trainers remind me\xfffeof that one from two years ago.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMore important, we must continue\xfffeour search.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLike that scientist said,\xfffeit might be in Opelucid City!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe'll play with you again later!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Get back here!\xf000븁\x0000
Do you want to hear that old tale\xfffeof Lacunosa Town again?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt always takes me a little time\xfffeto tell it.
There's a great big hole behind\xfffethis town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA long time ago, a huge meteorite fell\xfffefrom the sky and made the big hole.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA very scary monster was hiding\xfffeinside the meteorite!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople say the monster appeared in the\xfffevillage at night, with a freezing wind,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand it stole away people and Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo the villagers built big walls to keep\xfffethe monster out and made a rule that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeno one could go out after dark.\xf000븁\x0000
Whether you believe it or not\xfffeis up to you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut even now, the people of this town\xfffestay inside after dark.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe old stories and legends\xfffecontinue to influence our lives.
Oh, fine, fine.\xfffeCome back again when you have time.
Welcome to Lacunosa Town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn this town, people live as methodically\xfffeas clockwork from morning to night.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you live your life soaking up sunlight,\xfffeyou can sleep very well at night.
Lacunosa Town\xfffeMethodical and Orderly for Safety
The big scary monster that\xfffecomes out at night is\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea Pokémon, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt must be a really scary Pokémon\xfffeif everyone believes the legend\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand follows these rules...
My granny loves old stories!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm always having to listen\xfffeto her really, really long stories.
My grandma's stories were\xfffereally about Kyurem, it seems.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess old stories sometimes\xfffehave a kernel of truth to them.
There are a lot of people in the world,\xfffeand there are just as many different\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecharacteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since\xfffeI took a post here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSince nobody goes outside at night,\xfffeit's very peaceful.
So the reason nobody goes outside\xfffeat night and it's so peaceful\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis because of a Pokémon?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't know how to feel about that!
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My Pokémon just runs around on its own.\xfffeMaybe it doesn't need a Trainer?

Zinzolin: You're an impressive\xfffeTrainer to have made it this far.\xf000븁\x0000
Since you went to such trouble\xfffeto come here, I'll show you something.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is...\xf000븁\x0000
The legendary Pokémon of ice!\xfffeIts name is Kyurem!\xf000븁\x0000
The ice missiles we fired\xfffeinto Opelucid City were\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecreated with Kyurem's power\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Team Plasma's technology!\xf000븁\x0000
Well...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou could become a\xfffethreat to Team Plasma,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso we will eliminate you here!\xf000븁\x0000
Not with me around, you won't!\xf000븁\x0000
Thanks for removing the barrier!\xfffeThat was a big help!\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Hmph!\xfffeWe'll simply eliminate both of you!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm not going\xfffeto lose to Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, what is this place?\xf000븁\x0000
That Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's so icy...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould that be the source of\xfffethe attack on Opelucid City?\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Hmph. You're a smarter\xfffeTrainer than I expected.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you've got that much sense,\xfffewhy did you do something as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedangerous as sneaking into our base?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That should be obvious!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll do whatever it takes to get\xfffemy sister's Pokémon back!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre YOU the one who stole a\xfffePurrloin in Aspertia five years ago?\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: If it's just a Purrloin,\xfffesomeone probably stole it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand is using it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy can't you understand?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are other Purrloin.\xfffeWhy are you so fixated on this one?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's the ONLY Purrloin\xfffein the world that my late grandpa\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecaught for my little sister!\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: An individual's feelings...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo you, that's probably a\xfffematter of great importance.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut from the perspective of other\xfffepeople, it is a trifling matter indeed.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCompare those feelings against\xfffethe majesty of this ship!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis ship itself is a device that\xfffeuses the Pokémon Kyurem's power!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith this ship, this time we will\xfffeconquer Unova!\xf000븁\x0000
It looks like Kyurem\xfffehas fully recovered.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe'll put the DNA Splicers\xfffeto good use.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll let you take care of them,\xfffeShadow Triad!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Don't mess with me!\xfffeYou were the one who lost!\xf000븁\x0000
Haaahraa...

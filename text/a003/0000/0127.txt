Hee-hee!\xfffeI've been waiting for you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're a tough Trainer who can face the\xfffewind and not get blown off your feet!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm kinda excited about this battle!\xfffeWhy don't you and I have some fun?\xf000븁\x0000
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon and I are happy\xfffebecause for the first time in quite a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhile--about two years, I'd say--we\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecould fight with our full strength.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is an official League Gym Badge.\xfffeBut this is just a stepping-stone.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the\xfffeJet Badge from Skyla.\xf000븁\x0000
Wow, hot stuff!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith that many Gym Badges,\xfffePokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, I want you to have this TM\xfffeso that you'll always remember\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000
I wonder what Professor Juniper\xfffeis up to?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI did promise her a ride in my plane...
Two things that are both really fun:\xfffeflying my own plane and having my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon take me places using Fly!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well?\xfffeOur battle together was a ton of fun.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhenever my Pokémon think of our battle,\xfffethey want to start training again.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt might be a cool idea to take my plane\xfffeand go on a training trip together!
Ow...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, I'm sorry!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAllow me to apologize by giving you this\xfffeFresh Water! Take it, please.\xf000븁\x0000
This Gym is a wind tunnel!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen the propellers in back start\xfffespinning quickly, you'll be blown\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeaway like a certain someone just was!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you think the wind will blow,\xfffestay hidden behind a wall\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand wait for it to stop.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, Flying-type Pokémon have\xfffemore weaknesses than you might expect,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeincluding to Rock-, Electric-, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIce-type moves!

The Gym Leader, Clay, is currently\xfffein the middle of something.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease come back again later.
Team Plasma: C'mon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's have fun stealing Pokémon\xfffetogether, like we did before!\xf000븁\x0000
???: I can't.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've learned the hard way\xfffethat stealing from others is wrong!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Oh, come on! It's too late\xfffeto start acting all goody-two-shoes now!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: People don't understand\xfffeour just cause!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't they call you a villain\xfffewho was plotting world domination?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven though you quit Team Plasma, people\xfffeare still really cold to you, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, you might as well just come\xfffesteal Pokémon with us and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetake over the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe people who are mean to you now\xfffewill be groveling at your feet\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand saying how great you are!\xf000븁\x0000
Ex-Team Plasma: I can't...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy lord N will be sad...\xfffeI can't do that to him...\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: N!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTeam Plasma's king... What a joke!\xfffeHe's nothing more than a traitor!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe disappeared somewhere and abandoned\xfffeus when we needed him!\xf000븁\x0000
Hey!\xf000븁\x0000
Start talking, you Team Plasma trash!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Oww...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're gonna pay for that!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, yeah. Almost forgot...\xfffeI'm not supposed to cause any trouble.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll get you next time!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You're not getting away!\xf000븁\x0000
Ex-Team Plasma: I'm OK!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe were friends when we\xfffewere both in Team Plasma...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut two years ago, Team Plasma\xfffesplit into a group that follows Lord N,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho just wants to save Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand a group that follows Ghetsis,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho plans to take over the world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can hear the rest\xfffeof the story in our home.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's on that little hill next\xfffeto the Pokémon Gym.\xf000븁\x0000
Ex-Team Plasma: Sir, that's the person\xfffeI was talking about!\xf000븁\x0000
Over here! This way!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Oh! So you're interested\xfffein Team Plasma, are you?\xf000븁\x0000
Ex-Team Plasma: If you hear what\xfffewe have to say, you might be able\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto understand us.\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: My guest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're going to come inside,\xfffeI would like to see what kind\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof person you are, Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right. In a Pokémon battle.\xfffeDo you find this acceptable?
Rood: Let us begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Then, I'm afraid I must\xfffeask you to leave.
Rood: If you're going to come inside,\xfffeI would like to see what kind\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof person you are, Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right. In a Pokémon battle.\xfffeDo you find this acceptable?
Ex-Team Plasma: I'm sorry...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSage Rood is only saying\xfffethat in order to protect us.
Rood: I apologize for testing you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing former members of Team Plasma,\xfffewe must deal with a lot...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: He got away!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: And that is?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour friend?\xfffeHe may join us.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Challenging the Gym, huh?\xfffeNice! Keep getting stronger!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me tell you, though,\xfffeClay's tough!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if all you have to use against\xfffeGround types is Water-type Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou might still be in for a rough fight!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You got a Gym Badge, too!\xfffeI knew you could do it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou know... My partners are the reason\xfffeI was able to get that Badge.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I'm sure there's more connecting\xfffeus to each other than Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf that's all there is, the stolen\xfffePurrloin's feelings will never be\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat they were!\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: Oh, so you two squirts\xfffeknow each other, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYa both ain't bad, so\xfffeI wanna show ya somethin'.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Wait!\xfffeI just remembered. Clay...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy? What's the reason?\xfffeWhy have you forgiven Team Plasma?\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: There's always room for folks\xfffeto grow and change, ain't there?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd, if ya only go after what ya think is\xffferight, ya might end up rejectin' all\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethoughts and opinions other than\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyer own. That's mighty dangerous.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hmph...\xfffeIs that one of those compromises\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeadults are supposed to make?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhatever!\xfffeI'm gonna fight Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh yeah, what were you wanting\xfffeto show us?\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: Ya ever heard of the\xfffePokémon World Tournament?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrainers from all over the world\xfffegather on up to see who's toughest!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, I'll be waitin' for you at the\xfffesouth end of town!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: A tournament\xfffeto decide who's strongest, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRight on!\xfffeIt's time for some special training!\xf000븁\x0000
So how about this city's pride and joy,\xfffethe drawbridge?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe also call it the Charizard Bridge\xfffedue to its elegant form!
The Elite Four of the Pokémon League\xfffeare extremely tough!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hear you can't battle them unless\xfffeyou have eight Gym Badges!
When there's an item in your Bag\xfffeyou want to switch,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffejust press SELECT\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand give it a new niche! ♪\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoesn't that jingle take you back?
A long time ago, Team Plasma\xfffestole my Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, they did give it back later!
Rokorroook!
I want to level up my dear Pokémon\xfffeso they never have to feel\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe sting of defeat!
Whoooa, dude! If a Pokémon uses the move\xfffeSurf, it can catch a wave!
Even though I used to look\xfffeat the Cold Storage every day...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've already forgotten\xfffewhat it looked like...
A Pokémon of thunder and\xfffea Pokémon of wind were roaming\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeverywhere and causing trouble!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen they were punished\xfffeby a Pokémon of the soil.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI like that story!
On the other side of the ocean...\xfffeAnd all over the world, there sure\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeare a lot of different Pokémon!
There are former members of\xfffeTeam Plasma in there...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm worried that they might\xfffebe up to no good again...
Bridges connect different lands.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrading and battling with Pokémon\xfffecan connect different people.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess that means Pokémon\xfffeare a kind of bridge as well!
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wanted to get the attention of a girl\xfffeI like, so I learned a new style of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battling.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIts name... Rotation Battle!\xfffeWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\xfffereally hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three\xfffePokémon at a time and battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOne Pokémon takes the lead position,\xfffeand the other two stand on each side.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe trick is, each turn you can change\xfffetheir positions...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd that's a rough explanation\xfffeof Rotation Battles.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\xfffeRotation Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm always at full throttle.\xf000븁\x0000
I hate to burst your bubble when you're\xfffeall fired up, but...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn Rotation Battles, you need three or\xfffemore Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have some advice for you.\xfffeChallenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting\xfffeschooled when I was planning to teach.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, you have potential!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou have to understand your Pokémon\xfffeto win in a Rotation Battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you want more Rotation Battles,\xfffego to the Pokémon World Tournament!
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRiding a bike and becoming the wind fits\xfffea bad boy like me.

Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\xfffereally hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three\xfffePokémon at a time and battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe rules are simple: just make all of\xfffeyour opponent's Pokémon faint.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd that's a rough explanation\xfffeof Triple Battles.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\xfffeTriple Battle?

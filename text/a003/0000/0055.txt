Oh! You are the Pokémon Trainer\xfffeI met at the entrance!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou've come this far. That means\xfffeyou must be quite strong.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you prepared to face the strongest\xfffeperson in this building?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, the time has come to challenge\xfffemy grandson, the company president!\xf000븁\x0000
I'll show you just how much\xfffethis Battle Company has researched\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon and Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause you were strong,\xfffeand I was weak.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe must do even more research\xfffefor Pokémon and for Trainers!
Thinking that when you win\xfffeit's because of your Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand that when you lose\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit's because of yourself\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemight make you stronger...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut enjoying yourself\xfffeis much, much more important!
If you want to make a weak\xfffePokémon stronger, you should\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeuse that Exp. Share.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAny Pokémon that holds it receives\xfffeExp. Points, even when it doesn't\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeparticipate in battle!
My dream as president is to\xffferelease a device that lets\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepeople talk to Pokémon!

What will be determined here is\xfffewhich of us can absorb the opponent's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelight and shine...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut who will decide that?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt shall be I, Grimsley of the Elite Four,\xfffeand I will fulfill my duty to be\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour opponent.\xf000븁\x0000
Whether or not you get to fight at full\xfffestrength, whether or not luck smiles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon you--none of that matters.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnly results matter. And a loss is a loss.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSee, victory shines like a bright light.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd right now, you and your Pokémon\xfffeare shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than\xfffethe one who lost his light...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut this loss will make me shine\xfffeeven brighter next time...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I think that way, it's not too bad.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSigh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou should take that strength and test\xfffeit against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou have defeated every member of\xfffethe Pokémon League's Elite Four.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut it isn't over yet.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere is one more opponent against whom\xfffeyou must prove your strength.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCheck the statue in the central plaza,\xfffeand continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have\xfffeto use the tools you're given.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's more important to master the cards\xfffeyou're holding than to complain about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe ones your opponents were dealt.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet us begin.\xfffeAnd may the best Trainer win!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeContests like this are proof\xfffethat you are really living...\xf000븁\x0000
There are bad ways to win--\xfffeand good ways to lose.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's interesting and troubling is that\xfffeit's not always clear which is which.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA flipped coin doesn't always land\xfffeheads or tails.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes it may never land at all...
There's nothing left\xfffefor the loser.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess that's not true...\xfffeEverything has a meaning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI just have to use the disappointment\xfffeas a motivation to get strong.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat said...\xfffeYou should take that strength and test\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit against the rest of the Elite Four!

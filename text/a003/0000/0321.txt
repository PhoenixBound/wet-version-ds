Bianca: Hi there, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
Um, you know what?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's something I want to investigate\xfffehere in Reversal Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the wild Pokémon here are really\xfffetough, and I'm having trouble with them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould you come with me? Please?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! Don't worry!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll take care of healing\xfffeour Pokémon, OK?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeReady? Let's go!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere! This is the place!\xfffeLet's look around a little!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere! This is the place!\xfffeLet's look around a little!\xf000븁\x0000
Know what?\xfffeI didn't know what I was capable of,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso I left on a journey to find out!
I'm...\xfffeWell, I'm not the toughest Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I was able to continue my journey\xfffebecause my Pokémon worked so hard\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor me.
Trying to keep winning against\xfffeeveryone is really hard...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut it's easy to keep loving Pokémon,\xfffeand that makes it all worthwhile.
I always want to know more\xfffeabout the Pokémon I like!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I started working as\xfffeProfessor Juniper's assistant!
Actually, I'm not sure being a\xfffeprofessor's assistant is really\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat I want to do...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut when I do the work,\xfffeI have lots and lots of fun!
                              
                                
Oh! I want to do a little\xfffemore looking around.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWant to split up for now?
OK, then!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to do a little more research\xfffeabout where Heatran might be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThank you for coming with me!\xfffeBe careful on the rest of your journey!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, OK!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to do a little more\xfffeinvestigating about Heatran.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHeatran is a very rarely seen Pokémon,\xfffeso if I find out more about it,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeProfessor Juniper will be really happy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks for helping me!\xfffeBe careful on your journey!\xf000븁\x0000
OK! Then let's do a little more\xfffelooking around!\xf000븁\x0000
Reversal Mountain... I wonder...\xfffeCould a Magma Stone be in there?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave you heard of it?\xfffeThey say a Magma Stone was found\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a volcano in the distant Sinnoh region.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApparently, it had something\xfffeto do with Heatran!
There's still something I want to\xfffelook for in Reversal Mountain.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCome with me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't worry. I'll take care of healing\xfffeour Pokémon, OK?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK, here we go!\xf000븁\x0000
You strike me as the type\xfffewho fills out the Habitat List!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeC'mon, tell me what kind of Pokémon\xfffelive in Reversal Mountain!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh... Still looking into it, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome of the Pokémon are on the\xfffeoutside of Reversal Mountain as well.
Huh! That's amazing.\xfffeSo these Pokémon live here, then!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks for showing me something good!\xfffeLet me pay you back with this!\xf000븁\x0000
False Swipe leaves a Pokémon\xfffewith 1 HP when it would have fainted.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a very restrained move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a great TM to use for catching\xfffePokémon and filling out the Habitat List!

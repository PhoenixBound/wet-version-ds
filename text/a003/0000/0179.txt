My flaky fortune-telling says that\xfffeyou'll meet a Pokémon!
Going to the next town was a big\xfffeadventure when I was a kid!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh yeah! Here, I'll give you something\xfffeI always used to take with me back then!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUm... Now, where is it?\xfffeI'll look for it! Sorry!
Oh! You already have a Gym Badge!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a present from me!\xfffeI hope it helps you out!\xf000븁\x0000
The Ultra Ball is really good.\xfffeIt performs much better\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethan a regular Poké Ball!
I wonder if there's a Pokémon that was\xfffedropped on the ground somewhere...
It's the worst when you find the Pokémon\xfffeyou were looking for and you don't\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave any Poké Balls.

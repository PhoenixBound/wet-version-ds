A beautiful melody makes people happy.\xfffeA sad melody makes people sorrowful...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of\xfffea long-ago melody from the fringes of my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesepia-toned memories.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was a song my mother loved...\xfffeIt makes me feel so nostalgic.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you like to hear the melody?\xf000븁\x0000
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that\xfffeplayed a melody and danced so lightly\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat it filled people's hearts with joy.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen sorrow darkened the entire world,\xfffeand the Pokémon's melody was lost...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt the same time, somewhere,\xfffesome red shoes were lost...\xf000븁\x0000
When you came through the door,\xfffeI remembered the melody!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd the Pokémon that had forgotten how\xfffeto dance began to step lightly once more!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou are the inspiration.\xfffeYou are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAria Forme will become Pirouette Forme,\xfffeand vice versa.

This is your first visit to this café.\xfffeAm I correct?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease...\xf000븁\x0000
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here.\xfffeEnjoy...
I've been letting my tired mind relax\xfffein this café this whole time...
Listen to him playing guitar...\xfffeI went back to the home I'd left behind,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand my mother cried tears of joy...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's mothers for you.
You can't change your family,\xfffebut you can change how you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinteract with one another.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, that said...
Thanks to you and Meloetta,\xfffememories of my birthplace...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffememories of when I was little...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffememories of singing together after\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewe finished gathering Berries...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAll these memories came flooding back.\xf000븁\x0000

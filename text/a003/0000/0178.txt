Aspertia City is in the corner of the\xfffeUnova region, so this isn't exactly the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebig leagues for Pokémon battling.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you go to the center of Unova,\xfffethere are many Pokémon Trainers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can battle.
I wonder if everyone will change now\xfffethat we have a Pokémon Gym?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, if your friends get good at\xfffebattling, you'll want to get better\xf000븀\x0000\xfffealso, right?
I haven't battled with my Pokémon,\xfffeso it's still weak...
I'm going to try battling\xfffewith my Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I don't do anything because I'm afraid\xfffeit will get hurt, it will never get strong.
Yap! Yap yap!

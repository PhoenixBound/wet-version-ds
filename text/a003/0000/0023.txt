We learned that Deoxys changes\xfffeits Forme by coming into contact\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith the power of meteors.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh!\xfffeNow, this is a truly interesting artifact!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a replica of that Dark Stone!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave you heard of the\xfffeDark Stone?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is the form of the legendary\xfffePokémon Zekrom while it rests...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat? You've seen Zekrom?\xfffeThat's amazing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn that case, my explanation\xfffeis superfluous, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000

The library is in the next room.\xfffeBeyond that is the director's room.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, Lenora is a former\xfffeGym Leader!
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFrom the outside, you can't see their\xfffefunctional, efficient design.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's almost as if it is an embodiment of\xfffetheir former essence... So fascinating!
Rarities from around the world...\xfffeMuseums are packed with adventure!
I heard that the director, Lenora,\xfffeis too busy with her research\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon Fossils and Pokémon bones, so she\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetook a break from being a Gym Leader.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came\xfffefrom space along with this meteorite.
The Thick Club held by Marowak...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJust like how Cubone wears\xfffeits mother's skull,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMarowak could also battle with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe bone of someone dear to it...
You!\xfffeBones can talk!\xf000븁\x0000
You seem all right,\xfffebut it's natural for people\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto have different opinions.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't fight over it--enjoy it.\xfffeConsider why they might think like that!
This is a skeletal specimen from a\xfffePokémon that flew around the world.
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was\xfffeprotected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus\xfffeattached to it.

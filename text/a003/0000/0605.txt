Gurooooohhh!
Terrakion ran away past\xfffethe end of the route...
The one radiating such a\xfffetremendous presence before you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis none other than Terrakion!\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: It's been a long time.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTerrakion is one of the three Pokémon\xfffewho protected Pokémon from\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe flames of a human conflict!\xf000븁\x0000
It seems likely that Terrakion has\xfffepicked up the scent of danger that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeemanates from Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's probably seeking a Pokémon\xfffeTrainer who has the strength\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto stand up to them.\xf000븁\x0000
It's very interesting indeed that\xfffeTerrakion appeared before you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat aside, do you plan\xfffeto confront Team Plasma?\xf000븁\x0000
I see. If that's the case,\xfffeyou must have the power to protect\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour own Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing protected by Pokémon\xfffealone doesn't make you a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's because Trainers are strong,\xfffebecause they care about their Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat these Pokémon can also be strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere!\xfffeThis is from me!\xf000븁\x0000
I see!\xfffeThat works as well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou and your Pokémon\xfffecan proceed down your own path!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat you should do is care\xfffeabout your Pokémon to bring out\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetheir power to its fullest potential!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere!\xfffeThis is from me!\xf000븁\x0000
This is a prototype of my device\xfffethat energizes Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt doesn't work on battling Pokémon,\xfffebut you may find it useful for something!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, I wish you and your Pokémon\xfffea safe journey!\xf000븁\x0000
Now that I think about it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn the Seaside Cave on Route 21,\xfffeI saw something that reminded\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeme of when we met on Route 4.\xf000븁\x0000

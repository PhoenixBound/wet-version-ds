Colress: Welcome!\xf000븁\x0000
I was asked by an acquaintance\xfffeto help with his research.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat I desire is to bring out\xfffethe entirety of Pokémon potential!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I can accomplish that,\xfffeI don't care what it takes!\xf000븁\x0000
If it means this strength must be\xfffebrought out by the interactions\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebetween Pokémon and Trainers,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen so be it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf it means you have to use a merciless\xfffeapproach, like Team Plasma's,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand force out all of the Pokémon's power,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen so be it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd yes, if the entire world\xfffeis destroyed as a result,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen so be it...\xf000븁\x0000
That aside!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe reason I have been traveling all over\xfffeUnova and battling many Pokémon Trainers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis because I was testing the viability of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis approach to bringing out the full\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestrength of Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn that respect, you've done\xfffean amazing job.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell now! Tell me if you have\xfffethe answer I desire or not!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're ready, come at me!
It looks like you're ready, then!\xfffeOK! Let us begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Colress: So strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're a very strong Trainer indeed!\xfffeSo let me ask you this!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you thinking of reaching\xfffeeven higher heights by understanding\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeach other as Pokémon and Trainer?
I see...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo me, that is an ideal answer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo think! That's what you\xfffeactually believe!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou bring out the power of your\xfffePokémon with respect and love!\xf000븁\x0000
I see...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs that answer my truth?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if that's your answer,\xfffedon't give up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe reason you're so strong\xfffeis that you treat your Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith respect and love!\xf000븁\x0000
Excuse me for repeating myself,\xfffebut if it will make Pokémon stronger,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't care what it takes!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf interacting with Pokémon can increase\xfffetheir powers only to a certain point,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen their full strength must be brought\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeout using a scientific approach.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeEven one without a conscience.\xf000븁\x0000
But you have shown me the\xfffepotential of your approach.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo me, whether Team Plasma wins\xfffeor whether you win will decide\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehow the relationship between\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepeople and Pokémon should be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo where will this be settled?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStep on the warp panel on the other\xfffeside of the room where Kyurem is\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeing held.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGood luck in your battle!
Colress: Could I say that you're\xfffecurious for coming clear out here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI dissolved Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe ones who are left here are deciding\xfffewhat they want to do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI would like to have them decide\xfffehow to live on their own!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are far more questions in this\xfffeworld that don't have any answers!\xf000븁\x0000
Well then...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease show me you and your\xfffePokémon's strength once again!\xf000븁\x0000
In Pokémon battles where you can't\xfffeafford to make a mistake,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe true nature of the Trainer's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepersonality becomes clear.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI see!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf Trainers believe in their Pokémon\xfffeto the fullest extreme, as you do,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetheir Pokémon partners will also\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegive everything they have!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo that must be the answer\xfffeI've been looking for.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, I'm glad you won.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor one thing, I detested Ghetsis\xfffefrom the start!\xf000븁\x0000
Take this with you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis Master Ball can catch\xfffeany kind of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGhetsis was saving it,\xfffebut you'll probably put it to better use!\xf000븁\x0000
If you'd like, please have a\xfffePokémon battle with me again!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIndeed, I'm having trouble deciding\xfffewhat to do next as well.

Let me introduce myself again.\xfffeMy name is Rood.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You guys are all\xfffeTeam Plasma too, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTell me, what makes you different\xfffefrom the Team Plasma back there?!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: More accurately, we're\xfffeformer members of Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause of the incident two years ago,\xfffewe started taking care of the Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat were separated from their Trainers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas a way to atone for our misdeeds.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd you are?\xf000븁\x0000
I'm \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001.\xfffeFrom Aspertia City...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFive years ago, Team Plasma--I mean\xfffeyou--stole my little sister's Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm the pathetic Trainer who wasn't able\xfffeto stop you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“Separated?" What a joke!\xfffeYOU were the thieves who STOLE them!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Is that so...\xfffeMy sincerest apologies...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Just an apology?\xfffeThat's it?!\xf000븁\x0000
Where's my sister's Pokémon?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePurrloin! WHERE'S PURRLOIN?\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: The Pokémon you speak of\xfffeis not in this place.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI imagine it is still being\xfffeused by Team Plasma now.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJust as you say, our apologizing\xfffedoesn't solve anything.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut you can't move forward unless\xfffeyou admit you were wrong and apologize...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Enough already!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApologizing isn't going to get\xfffemy sister's Pokémon back!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeI'm going to the Pokémon Gym!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll get stronger and crush every\xfffesingle member of Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Team Plasma made\xfffeTrainers like him suffer...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel terrible about it...\xfffeHow foolish we were...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, as you can see,\xfffeI can't do anything to thank you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeActually, I have a favor to ask of you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould you please look after this\xfffePokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Could you please look after this\xfffePokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Oh! Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000
Rood: Oh! Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...But what's this? It seems you can't\xfffetake any more Pokémon with you.
Rood: If you change your mind,\xfffeplease come speak to me again.
This Zorua was one of my lord N's friends,\xfffeand it supported him.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn the Unova region, there are many\xfffeother Pokémon that helped my lord N\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebesides this Zorua.
That Zorua is one of the Pokémon\xfffethat my lord N relied on as a friend\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeduring his journey.
My lord N is a wonderful person\xfffewho has the power to understand\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe hearts of Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut still, he has much to learn about\xfffeunderstanding the hearts of people...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope he will develop this skill while\xfffehe travels with the legendary Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto atone for the trouble he caused\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein Unova as the king of Team Plasma.
Team Plasma is an organization\xfffecreated by a man named Ghetsis\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto help him take over the Unova region.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe one he groomed to help him\xfffefurther his nefarious aims was N.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeN was a strange boy who was\xfffecalled the child of the Pokémon.
I wonder if N understands now.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrainers battle with Pokémon not to hurt\xfffethem, but so Trainers and Pokémon can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeunderstand one another better!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's the simplest way\xfffefor them to do this.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe more serious the battle,\xfffethe more the true nature of Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand people becomes apparent!
N was an orphan.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard that right after he was born,\xfffehe upset people with behavior that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesuggested he could talk to Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen he was living in the woods\xfffewith Darmanitan and Zorua,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGhetsis took him in.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe are also orphans Ghetsis took in.\xfffeOur task was to take care of N.
I don't understand N's\xfffepure and innocent feelings.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I will be very happy if he\xfffefigured out what he wants to do\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon his own during his travels\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith the legendary Pokémon.
I'm waiting for my lord N to return.\xfffeHe can talk to Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf he comes back, we can find out\xfffewhat the Pokémon here want.
We're taking care of the Pokémon\xfffewhose Trainers we can't find.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI know it seems arrogant,\xfffebut it's a small way to make up\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor what we've done.
You can't change the past,\xfffebut you can change the future!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I changed my outfit.\xfffeI can still fit into the old one, though!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeReally!
This Pokémon has become attached to me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'm treating it like\xfffea friend and not like a tool!
Bwoaf bowoaf!
Swwaaa!
Scrarara!
Skreeree...
Yeowwln!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard that Team Plasma left\xfffemany Pokémon behind when they fled.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I'm helping find their\xfffereal Trainers...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat aside...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSince you're here, you should have a\xfffebattle with me before you go!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffehave a battle with me before you go!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Here I come!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Well, that's all right\xfffetoo, I guess!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I suppose that's it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf winning in battles is strength,\xfffethen believing that your Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill come back and waiting for its return\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis also strength.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoing what you think is right\xfffeno matter what anyone else says,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike these guys do, is strength, too.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeCome back tomorrow!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll take you on again!\xfffeThat's my way of saying thanks!
Kwip yip!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 received Zorua!

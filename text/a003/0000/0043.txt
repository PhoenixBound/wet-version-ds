Liberty Garden, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA long time ago, an extremely rich\xfffeperson hid a very amazing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon called Victini there!
Ho ho! Trying to become stronger\xfffeby misusing Victini's powers...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTeam Plasma fell apart exactly because\xfffethey planned to do things like that!
It is small compared to a luxury liner.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the size of a ship doesn't change the\xfffefeeling of adventure when you're out on\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe open sea.\xf000븁\x0000
Would you like to go to Liberty Garden?
Your timing is perfect.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe ship is about to leave.\xfffePlease get aboard the ship and wait.\xf000븁\x0000
If you'd like to go to Liberty Garden,\xfffeplease let me know.\xf000븁\x0000
Would you like to go\xfffeto Liberty Garden again?

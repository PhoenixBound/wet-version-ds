Professor Juniper: Well, I suppose\xfffeI should tell you why\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI brought you out here.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren told me that a group of people\xfffecalling themselves Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeare planning to use legendary Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto take over the Unova region.\xf000븁\x0000
As you may know, in the Unova region,\xfffethere are two legendary\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDragon-type Pokémon:\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeZekrom and Reshiram...\xf000븁\x0000

But two years ago, Zekrom and Reshiram\xfffeeach recognized a Trainer as a hero.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey are following those Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo Team Plasma shouldn't be able\xfffeto use the Dragon-type Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000

Bianca: That's true...\xfffeWhat could they be planning?\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: There is much we\xfffedon't know about Zekrom and Reshiram...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I want to hear what\xfffeOpelucid City's Gym Leader, Drayden,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehas to say about this.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe's a Dragon-type Gym Leader,\xfffeso he might know something.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, we're finally to the reason\xfffewhy I brought you here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want you to go to Opelucid City\xfffeand hear what Drayden has to say.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd, I would also like you\xfffeto help me if something happens!

Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's really best not to get\xfffeinvolved with Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto start with.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut still...\xf000븁\x0000
Yes.\xfffeThat is the more reasonable response.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's best not to get involved\xfffewith Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut...\xf000븁\x0000
Hearing what Drayden has to say\xfffeabout the Dragon-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill be really interesting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd more importantly, it will help\xfffefill up the pages of your Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: I'll be in the volcano\xfffejust beyond here...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to investigate the rumors\xfffeI've been hearing about a rare\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFire-type Pokémon in Reversal Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden is a Gym Leader,\xfffeso unless you defeat him in a Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebattle, he probably won't talk to you.
If the season changes,\xfffethe scenery from the plane changes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf the climate changes,\xfffethe local architecture changes!
Why am I on a journey?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you remember exactly\xfffewhy you're traveling?

It was two years ago when the two\xfffedragon Pokémon were awakened.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe black dragon Pokémon, Zekrom,\xfffepursued what is ideal, with the desire\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto usher in a new world of hope.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd the white dragon Pokémon, Reshiram,\xfffesought what is true, with the desire\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto usher in a new world of goodness.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeZekrom and Reshiram\xfffewere once a single Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000

You may wonder why it split in two.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe single dragon Pokémon had helped the\xfffetwin heroes bring a new region into being.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the twin heroes--the older brother\xfffewho sought the truth and the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyounger brother who sought ideals--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesundered the region in two as they\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefought to see which of them was right.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn that desperate hour, the single\xfffedragon Pokémon split its body into a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeblack Pokémon and a white Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeven though ideals and truth\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedon't need to be in opposition!\xf000븁\x0000

As the story goes, a third\xfffedragon Pokémon, \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Kyurem\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffealso came into existence in that era.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd there may be proof of this to be\xfffefound in a treasure passed down in my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefamily for generations: the DNA Splicers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeProfessor Juniper's research determined\xfffethat the materials in the splicers date\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeback to the same era as the materials\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeused in building the Dragonspiral Tower.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, the DNA Splicers\xfffeare stored very safely.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guard them because I don't know\xfffewhat kind of power might lie within them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut here's what's been bothering me...\xfffeCould there be one more dragon Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if Kyurem really exists,\xfffewe don't know what kind of Pokémon it is.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor starters, the two Pokémon\xfffethe ancient Pokémon split into\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeare both overwhelmingly powerful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo if Kyurem exists, could it be just\xfffea husk--a shell that was left over?\xf000븁\x0000
Boom!\xf000븁\x0000
Drayden: Hm?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat was that sound?\xf000븁\x0000

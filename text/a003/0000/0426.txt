A woman was living here with\xfffea group of Patrat.\xf000ｸ―x0000\xfffeI wonder where they went.
Seeing Watchy Watchog on TV\xfffereminds me of those Patrat.
Why don't we move into this house?\xf000ｸ―x0000\xfffeThose musicians are always nearby.\xfffeIsn't that nice?
I learned all the names\xfffeof the musicians!\xf000ｸ―x0000\xfffeDerleth, Aickman,\xfffeRusso, and Koontz.
What do you think? We've been indecisive\xfffefor two years. Let's live here, shall we?
Maybe we should move in.\xf000ｸ―x0000\xfffeWe don't even know when the villa\xfffein Undella Town will be finished...

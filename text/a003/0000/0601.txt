Bianca: Heeey!\xfffeThis way!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Come on!\xfffeThis way!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: This kinda reminds me\xfffeof that day on Route 1.\xf000븁\x0000
OK, here's how it works.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokédex's pages fill up\xfffeautomatically when you meet Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd when you catch a Pokémon,\xfffemore detailed information on it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis added to the Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, I'll show you how to catch\xfffea Pokémon! Starting...NOW!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: What a relief!\xfffeI caught a Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh! Um...\xfffeRight. I'll go over the important stuff.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst, go find a healthy\xfffePokémon to catch!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou need to remember this next bit!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's best to lower the Pokémon's HP\xfffebefore you try to catch it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUse your Pokémon's moves to lower the HP\xfffeof the Pokémon you want to catch.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMaking it fall asleep or paralyzing it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill make it even easier to catch!\xf000븁\x0000
You're going to go deliver\xfffethe Town Map to your friend, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Continue straight this way\xfffeto get to Floccesy Town!\xf000븁\x0000
Bye now!\xfffeMeet lots of Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand catch a lot of them, OK?\xf000븁\x0000
???: You there, Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000

And you are?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmph! So you're \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000\xfffefrom Aspertia City!\xf000븁\x0000
Your \xf000ā\x0001\x0001 is\xfffea fine-looking Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, you're not exactly\xfffea seasoned Trainer yet...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIndeed! I'll train you a little!\xfffeFollow me!\xf000븁\x0000
Hey, you know about ledge jumping?
Oh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess you would know you can\xfffejump off these little ledges.
That so...\xfffeWell then, watch me carefully!\xf000븁\x0000
From the top of the ledge!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBoing!\xf000븁\x0000
It's really cool how you can take\xfffeshortcuts by jumping off these, right?
          
           
                                                                                               
                         
                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                   
Know what? I'm searching for\xfffePokémon in the tall grass!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! If you don't want\xfffeto meet Pokémon, avoid the tall grass!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
Excuse me! I forgot to tell\xfffeyou something important!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst, take these!\xf000븁\x0000
Those are Oran Berries!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you give one to your Pokémon,\xfffeits HP will be restored.\xf000븁\x0000
What's more! You can give your Pokémon\xfffea Berry to hold!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLike this Oran Berry, for instance.\xfffeWhen a Pokémon holds this Berry, it can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeat the Berry if it gets hurt in the heat\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof battle and regain some of its lost HP!\xf000븁\x0000
Well... I just told you\xfffeto challenge the Gym Leader.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAspertia's Gym Leader\xfffeis a very strong Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut you have nothing to worry about!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you think hard about what the\xfffePokémon at your side can do,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand what you should do as a Trainer,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffevictory will be yours!\xf000븁\x0000
And then you should take on\xfffestronger and stronger Trainers...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeActually, take on the Gym Leaders\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof each city!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWorking together with your Pokémon\xfffeis what makes you grow as a Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs you and your Pokémon grow stronger,\xfffeyour world will get broader!\xf000븁\x0000

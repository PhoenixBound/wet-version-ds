Let's see how well we've\xffferaised our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we're this strong, Team Plasma will\xffferun screaming when they see us!\xf000븁\x0000
I won't let 'em get away, though!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHer Purrloin...\xfffeI'll get it back for sure!\xf000븁\x0000
So, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeKeep helping me out!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, continue to work hard\xfffeon the Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're the one who was officially\xfffeasked to complete it, after all!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt isn't like I came here because\xfffeI heard rumors about Cynthia\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeing here and I wanted to challenge\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeher or anything...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was interested in the Abyssal Ruins!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSee! Here's proof! You can have it!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It's Dive!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have a Pokémon that knows it,\xfffeyou can dive to the ocean floor.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have\xfffefound my sister's Purrloin...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOr should I say her Liepard...\xf000븁\x0000
OK! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's see who are Aspertia's\xfffestrongest Pokémon!
Go get 'em, guys!\xf000븁\x0000
What's the deal?\xfffeDon't act all cool.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm really glad you're my friend!\xf000븁\x0000
Undellaaaaa!
The Pokémon World Tournament...\xfffeI wonder if Cynthia will participate, too.
Cynthia is participating in the\xfffePokémon World Tournament!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI have to cheer for her!
The Riches moved far away,\xfffeand it's a little bit lonelier around here.
The sunlight is strong...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDepending on the Pokémon, that can be\xfffeeither an advantage or a disadvantage.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStrong sunlight makes Fire-type moves\xfffestronger and Water-type moves weaker.
Yaaaay! Yaaay!\xfffeUndella Town!!
Sometimes Jellicent\xfffefloat into Undella Bay.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey have a reputation for\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeing a little...unusual.
We're starting construction to\xfffefurther develop Undella's resorts.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe just connected to the volcano,\xfffeand we're in awe of nature's power!
Undella Town\xfffeA Town of Rippling Waves

Zinzolin: Mmm, it's so warm here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me get to the point.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have papers that\xfffeLord Ghetsis left behind.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith these, you can read the ancient\xfffescripts in the Abyssal Ruins.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs my own small, little way to atone\xfffefor my sins, I'll read them to you!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 is now able to read\xfffethe Abyssal Ruins script!
Just to make sure you know,\xfffeyou reach the Abyssal Ruins\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby using Dive in Undella Bay.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd you must write down the\xfffeciphers you find in the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAbyssal Ruins by yourself.
According to Lord Ghetsis's papers,\xfffethe ancient peoples read in the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeopposite direction to how we read now.\xf000븁\x0000
This is what was written\xfffein the papers...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you reach the second floor,\xffferead by shifting one letter.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you reach the third floor,\xffferead by shifting two letters.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat I mean by “shifting" is replacing\xfffea letter with the previous\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeletter in the alphabet.\xf000븁\x0000
The king must be the presence that\xfffestopped the war and united the people.\xf000븁\x0000
The king could see the future\xfffeand talk to all living things.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHe united the people.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf that is the truth,\xfffehe was just like the hero!\xf000븁\x0000
There are some characters I can't\xffferecognize, but based on the context...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAn extremely wonderful king\xfffewas laid to rest in those ruins.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf that king has descendants,\xfffemaybe those special powers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewere passed down...\xf000븁\x0000
What?!\xfffeYou made it even further, you say?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd what kind of ciphers were there?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAhem... Oh, yes, now I see.\xf000븁\x0000
Keep searching!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need to write down the\xfffeAbyssal Ruins ciphers.
Now that I've learned everything\xfffeI wanted to know about the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAbyssal Ruins, I take my leave.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou are my enemy,\xfffebut your accomplishments and skill\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemake you a worthwhile enemy. Adieu!\xf000븁\x0000
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 picked up the Xtransceiver.\xf000븁\x0000

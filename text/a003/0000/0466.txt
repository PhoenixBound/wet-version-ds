I see!
Yes.
Mmmh!
Well then...
Looking forward to it.
Sensei!\xfffeYou called?\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: You're looking well!\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: Hey, I heard you're\xfffegoing back to acting!\xf000븁\x0000
Brycen: Indeed!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTeam Plasma's actions\xfffestirred the hearts of the public.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople even worry about\xfffehow to interact with Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, it's good to think\xfffeabout that relationship, but still...\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: Even if you're told to find\xfffean answer on your own...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's not exactly an easy thing\xfffeto do now, is it?\xf000븁\x0000
Brycen: That's why...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf people can see my bond with my Pokémon\xfffewhen they're watching my movies,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit might ease their worries...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat was my reasoning...\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: Oh! I get it now!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan't communicate that just\xfffeby holing up in the Gym and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetalking to challengers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, are you gonna be all right?\xfffeWhat if you get hurt during filming again?\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: Marshal...\xfffeBrycen has already decided.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes worrying can\xfffedestroy potential.\xf000븁\x0000
Brycen: I'm fine.\xfffeI have no doubts about my decision.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, I appreciate Marshal's concern.\xf000븁\x0000
I was young...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI thought I could do\xfffeany kind of action scene.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I would put myself in\xfffeunnecessary danger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI thought this bravery was\xfffemy value as a person.\xf000븁\x0000
So... Instead of trying to communicate\xfffesomething through my acting,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI simply sought amazing action.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat was how I got hurt.\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: I think I understand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you seek strength for its own sake,\xfffethe reason why you wanted it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the first place becomes vague.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd you end up desiring\xfffevictory and nothing else.\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: That's why I've also made\xfffean important decision.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to resign as Champion!\xf000븁\x0000
We in particular need to take another\xfffelook at what it means to live together\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe world at large is still shaken\xfffeby uncertainty.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I have to show everyone\xfffea new hope.\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: Well, if that's what\xfffeyou've decided, Sensei.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if I argue, that won't\xfffechange your decision, will it?\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: You've grown so much since you\xfffesought me out and asked to be my pupil.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould that be it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDid becoming part of the Elite Four\xfffehelp you grow up in its own way?\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: I thought that if I were strong,\xfffemy Pokémon would become stronger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe I grew up because my Pokémon\xfffetaught me that this isn't always\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe case...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, will you spar with me?\xf000븁\x0000
Brycen: I will observe.\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: Thank you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to be sure my Pokémon are in\xfffetop condition to challenge the Trainer\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho will become the next Champion.\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: To strength!\xf000븁\x0000
Marshal: To Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000

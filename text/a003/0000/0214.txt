This happened around when the hero\xfffeappeared in Opelucid City with the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelegendary dragon Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Right around here, you would\xfffehear a very sad cry.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen a bright-green Pokémon would\xffferun around like the wind.\xf000븁\x0000
I've heard it's called Virizion, and it\xfffetook up against humans to protect\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon from a war between people.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's apparently a legendary Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe it was afraid that Team Plasma's\xffferising to power would ruin the world and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeits friends' homes would be destroyed.

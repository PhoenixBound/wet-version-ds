...When I fall asleep in my bed.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...When my Pokémon's attack\xfffehits critically!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy life is full of things\xfffethat bring me joy!
I'm a battling Clerk ⑭!\xfffeIf I don't give up, I'll win someday!
Everyone's faces blend together!\xfffeIs that because I'm tired?
When you're tired, rest!\xfffeDon't force yourself to be energetic!
Should I change my Pokémon's moves\xfffeor its held items?
To live surrounded by people,\xfffedo you have to grow to like everyone,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeor do you only have to like yourself?
I wonder what Castelia\xfffewas like before it got this big.
It's wonderful how the Pokémon\xfffeand women here are so full of life!
The Battle Company needs\xfffepeople for focus testing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrainers who are confident in\xfffetheir abilities should come try it!
Seasons and trends always pass...

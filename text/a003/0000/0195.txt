The flat part of Stunfisk is\xfffevery charming, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you know other Water-type Pokémon\xfffewith a slender body?
Oh!\xfffeThe heart-shaped Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWow! It's called Luvdisc!\xfffeGreat! So slender!
Oh? Your Bag is full of\xfffeHeart Scales!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCome visit me again\xfffewith Luvdisc!
Stunfisk and Luvdisc both\xfffehave slender bodies!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut whether it is vertically slender\xfffeor horizontally slender\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegives a different impression!
The Pokémon's name starts with “L"\xfffeand it looks like a heart! I think.
If you sleep on Stunfisk,\xfffeits electricity relaxes the body!

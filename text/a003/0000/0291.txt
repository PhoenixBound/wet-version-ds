Rood: Oh! You're safe!\xfffeI'm so glad!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs for Team Plasma's ship,\xfffea man in a white lab coat appeared.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe said that a Trainer had given\xfffehim the answer he'd been seeking,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand, as thanks, he would disband\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTeam Plasma...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen he said, “Farewell! Walk a just path\xfffewith Pokémon!" and he flew the ship away.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo everything has been resolved.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe were even able to confirm\xfffethat Lord N is safe.
I'm in no position to say anything.\xfffeIn the past, I stole Pokémon, too.
I wonder if that guy who ran off\xfffehad figured something out...

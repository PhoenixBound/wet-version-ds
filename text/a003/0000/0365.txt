                                             
                                         
                   
A barrier was deactivated!
All barriers were deactivated,\xfffeand you can proceed now.
Team Plasma: At last, we meet again!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRemember me? Formerly of Team Plasma?\xfffeI've been waiting for you.\xf000븁\x0000
Gah! Spying is such a rotten job.\xfffeI contacted Rood of the Seven Sages,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut nobody showed up to help me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't stand it. Everybody around me is\xfffealways saying bad stuff about Lord N.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut Lord N learned the error of his ways\xfffeand changed course to a better path.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYet they call him a betrayer!\xfffePeople really stink sometimes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey selfishly counted on him, and\xfffenow they selfishly make a big fuss\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeabout being betrayed.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! I nearly forgot to tell you!\xfffeThis floor is a maze of pipes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou've got to step on switches\xfffeto connect or disconnect the pipes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a good thing you can walk\xfffeon the pipes.\xf000븁\x0000
You know what troubles me...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow come all of us who were in\xfffeTeam Plasma together--thinking we\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeknew what was right--are now divided\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto former Team Plasma members and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecontinuing Team Plasma members,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeboth with opposing points of view?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhere's the line between friend and foe?\xfffeI spend a lot of time asking myself that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs for you, on this floor, you'll need\xfffeto deactivate barriers to continue on.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDeactivate them by stepping on switches.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMove around by stepping on warp panels,\xfffeand you'll find four switches.
Zinzolin: The device is indestructible!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou will never be able to release Kyurem!\xf000븁\x0000
You don't have the sense to know\xfffewhen to quit, it seems.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's an act of mercy on my part\xfffeto bring this to an end now!\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: Beaten again?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo matter!\xfffeTeam Plasma will get the last laugh!
It looks like it controls the\xfffetemperature inside the ship.
It's a device to control\xfffethe ship's energy system.
Haahra...
Humph! If you intend to continue,\xfffestep on the other warp panel.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeKeep in mind that you're going\xfffeto get beaten up if you do!
What?! You beat Colress?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWaaah! I pretended to be strong,\xfffebut I don't have any Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, poor Kyurem. Ghetsis's device\xfffecruelly forced it to work.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt must have felt terrible.
The Plasma Frigate is a ship designed\xfffeto be ecological. It runs on\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeKyurem's ice energy and solar panels.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou've got to keep the environment in\xfffemind when ruling a region like Unova.
Colress doesn't know N.\xfffeI wonder how he'll react if he meets him.
Be careful!\xfffeThe barriers are electrified!

\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Again?!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Wait!\xf000븁\x0000
No need to be suspicious!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis uniform is just a disguise.\xfffeI'm ex-Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat I am now is a spy, to guard against\xfffeanything bad they might cook up.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It must be a hard job,\xfffekeeping an eye on your former allies.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSay, you don't know anything about a\xfffePurrloin stolen in Aspertia, do you?\xf000븁\x0000
S-sorry, but I don't know\xfffeanything about that...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's what I figured.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wouldn't expect someone from a\xfffegroup bent on world domination\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto be all that quick on the uptake.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I honestly wanted\xfffeto save Pokémon...
In this ship, the Plasma Frigate,\xfffeyou move around by using warp panels.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLook sharp!
In order to reach the heart of\xfffethis ship, you need a password.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease get the password from\xfffethe members of Team Plasma.
I can't remember how to use\xfffethe warp panels to get around.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd they won't give me a Pokémon yet...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut even a guy like me has\xfffesomething useful to share.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou step on four switches\xfffeto remove the barrier!
I just joined Team Plasma, and\xfffethey won't give me a Pokémon yet.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut even a guy like me has\xfffesomething useful to share.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need the Plasma Card\xfffeto enter the password!
Team Plasma has disbanded...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I finally just learned how to\xfffeuse the warp panels to get around!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm so frustrated!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I'm going to stay here and use\xfffethe warp panels as much as I want!

The number of Trainers on the\xfffeRoyal Unova today is \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0003.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe ship is nearing the port.\xfffeWould you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship!\xfffeI would like to give you advice 'cause\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou need help finding Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long\xfffestories, and they just keep talking\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeuntil they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation\xfffedeck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with\xfffeblue doors for someone to battle,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the\xfffecabins with blue doors today is \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0002.
It's running on the ocean!\xfffeWhat a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to\xfffethe observation deck or battle some\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTrainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves,\xfffebut it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing\xfffethe scenery from the deck...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis ship is the best!
I've been wondering which cabin to enter\xfffethis whole time!
I came here from Johto for business,\xfffebut everything is dynamic here.
Oh! Nice timing!\xfffeI wanted to talk to someone!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm here from Johto\xfffeon a business trip!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you feel like people here are\xfffea little cold? A little too suave, maybe?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I get nervous and have a\xfffehard time making friends.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, even today, it's my day off,\xfffeand I'm here riding a ship all alone!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTell me how people make\xfffefriends here in Unova!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease! Come on!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're busy?\xfffeCouldn't you do something? Please!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh, it's so nice to have a nice\xfffelong conversation. Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! A whistle is blowing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSorry to bother you when you're busy!\xfffeI hope you find some Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll find some friends here\xfffeby doing what you said!
Even on their days off, corporate\xfffewarriors are ready for battle! Let's go!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how many times we battle,\xfffeI can't compete with you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll just relax and enjoy\xfffemy boat ride!
You see, when going to a town on the\xfffecoast, I always travel by cruise ship.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can take another look at places\xfffethat you've walked and get a new\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeperspective on them from the sea.
When I'm relaxing like this,\xfffeI often remember the Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI've raised up until this point.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere were a few clumsy ones,\xfffebut they were all the best\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegroup of Pokémon you could want!
I've been traveling all over\xfffebecause I wanted to prove\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon from the same place as me\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecan make it anywhere in the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI won't lose to you either!\xf000븁\x0000
Trainers like you are hanging\xfffeout all over the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThinking about that gets\xfffeme really pumped up!
I hear there are people on this ship\xfffefrom many places, like Kanto, Johto,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Sinnoh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNot only can you see pretty scenery\xfffefrom the ship, it looks like you can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesee some unusual Pokémon!
I was on the deck with my arms\xfffespread out and feeling like\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI was a Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen the ship suddenly shook,\xfffeand I thought I was going to fall!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSigh... I wish I had someone to save\xfffeme right away at times like that.
Ta daaah! Good guess!\xfffeGet ready for battle. Here I come!\xf000븁\x0000
I've been waiting\xfffefor a Trainer to challenge me!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI was really sick of waiting!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks for talking to me!
Hey! Doesn't this ship\xfffeget you all excited?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI went completely wild while\xfffeI was all wound up like this...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen they locked me up in this room...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI won't cause any more trouble!\xfffeLet me out of this room!
Pickin' a fight with me, huh?\xfffeHeh! You don't know what\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou're getting yourself into!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHuh? What? Where are my Poké Balls?\xfffeOh! I left them at home!
I feel sick...\xfffeBut I'm a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm not going to lose to seasickness!\xfffeLet's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Urrg!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSorry!\xfffeLeave me alone for a minute...
Know what? I love this ship!\xfffeI mean, it's royal!
Hey, get a load of this!\xfffeEveryone's so mean!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey're calling me selfish\xfffeand saying I blabber too much!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven though I'm the quiet and kind\xfffeand cute girl that everyone adores!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeChanging the subject,\xfffewhat kind of Pokémon do you like?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh... Never mind. More importantly,\xfffeisn't this outfit cute?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI really like this brand...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow rude!\xfffeHow dare you say I talk too much!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! A whistle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI just talked a little, and\xfffenow it's already this late!
So, I recently moved here to Unova!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey, I've got some Pokémon you\xfffedon't usually see around here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's have a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Aren't my Pokémon cute?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to catch lots of\xfffePokémon here, too!
You want to battle?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh for pity's sake, this is why Trainers\xfffeare just a bunch of uncouth brutes...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo something other than\xfffebattle for a change.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about you enjoy this\xfffeelegant moment quietly?
I hear the Royal Unova\xfffehas been sailing around Castelia City\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesince before I was born!
Nice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was bored, because Mommy and Daddy\xfffeare on the deck! Let's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I have to wonder about parents\xfffewho would leave their child to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffego talk about love on the deck!
The wind's strong today,\xfffeso I'm relaxing in my room.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll have this lovely room\xfffeall to myself until we return to port! ♪
The first whistle means\xfffe“Hello, nice to meet you!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe second whistle means\xfffe“The ocean's lovely today!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe third and fourth whistles mean\xfffe“Are you enjoying your sea voyage?"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe fifth whistle means\xfffe“Thanks, and see you again!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIsn't it a nice feeling to think\xfffethe ship talks like this?
You! You came to pick up\xfffecute little me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTee hee hee! I'll be your opponent\xfffein an amazing Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
That's right... You're going to\xfffetake Pokémon with you, not me!
From your standpoint,\xfffeI'm a Trainer from beyond the sea,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand from my standpoint,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou're a Trainer from beyond the sea!

Please sit down.\xfffeI'll pour you some tea.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease, don't be bashful!\xfffeA Gentleman must entertain\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeguests who are kind enough\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto visit his room.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCome now.

Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers?\xfffeSorry, I don't know where to find them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the crew may know where they are.
As I left my body to the\xfffeswaying of the sea,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea rich poem sprung\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeup from the depths of my soul.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe title is,\xfffe“Everything's Blue!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me read it to you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, ocean! You're blue!\xfffeSky! You're blue, too!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI talk a blue streak!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm afraid that in a blue moon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat sunset will turn a baby blue!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy next poem is,\xfffe“Everything's Red!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK!

You're looking for a Trainer?\xfffeI'm sorry I didn't notice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was sure that you were\xfffewandering around looking\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor a wonderful poem!
Hee hee! Looking for a Trainer?\xfffeI'm an old woman, but do you mind?\xf000븁\x0000
Battling on the ocean\xfffesure has charm, doesn't it?
I hear there is a troublesome\xfffeguy somewhere in the cabins\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho just goes on and on.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe's called the Seviper guy because\xfffehe resembles a Pokémon.
Ho ho! You talked to me, didn't you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnce I've sunk my fangs into you,\xfffeI never let go!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEveryone on this cruise ship\xfffelikens me to a Pokémon--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm the Seviper guy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, c'mon. I'm so lonely!\xfffeI want to talk to young people!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell now, first of all, listen\xfffeto me complain about work...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Huh?\xfffeWhat was I going to talk about again?\xf000븁\x0000
I don't care how many\xfffetimes the whistle blew--I'm lonely!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't leave me!

I was Iris's coach!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven from the day Iris came here,\xfffeshe was so much stronger than me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow, I wouldn't stand a chance!
Even Drayden can't handle a\xfffestrange situation like this alone...
Drayden teaches the move Draco Meteor.\xfffeIt's the strongest Dragon-type move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the Special Attack of the Pokémon\xfffethat uses it drops sharply.
Concerned about your Pokémon's weight?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou don't need to put it on a diet!\xfffeJust let it hold this.\xf000븁\x0000
The weight of a Pokémon holding a\xfffeFloat Stone will be halved!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat way, you can reduce the damage\xfffecaused by weight-based moves such as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLow Kick and Grass Knot.
Wh-what's going\xfffeto happen to Opelucid City?
I have an item that I don't know how to\xfffeuse. Would you give it a try and see if\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can make it work?
I know...\xfffeYou'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!\xf000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can\xfffebe hit even by a move that would usually\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave no effect.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor example, a Normal-type move would\xfffehit a Ghost-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMastering this item is a bit tough...\xfffeActually, it's very tough, but think\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehow useful it could be!
It's cold...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd Dragon types really don't like cold!

Cheren: Come with me, you two.\xf000븁\x0000
See the dark tall grass here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's rare, but sometimes two\xfffePokémon pop out at the same time.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, the Pokémon that hide in\xfffedark grass are slightly stronger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo be careful if you walk through.\xf000븁\x0000

I have to get stronger\xfffethan Team Plasma!
Yeesh! I really hate it when\xfffepeople won't let things go!\xf000븁\x0000
Now that I think about it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I run this way, no one can help me!\xfffeI have to head toward the ocean!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, with that in mind...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to flee again!\xfffeGood-bye, Virbank City!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Well, they're\xfffereally good at running, anyway...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, she just said something useful!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey must be moving around by boat!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCastelia City has a big port...\xfffeI wonder if they headed there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK!

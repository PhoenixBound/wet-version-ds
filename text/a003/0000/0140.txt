Wonderful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm grateful that we had a chance\xfffeto meet and battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt reminded me that Pokémon battles\xfffeare about working with others\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto meet our challenges together.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 received the Legend Badge\xfffefrom Drayden!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, now. You've obtained seven of\xfffethe Gym Badges in Unova.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means Pokémon up to Lv. 80,\xfffeincluding those received in trades,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill follow your commands obediently.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI also want you to have this.\xfffeIt's a TM I'm particularly fond of.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's called Dragon Tail.\xf000븁\x0000
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the\xfffedamaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn other words, it switches your\xfffeopponent's Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper asked me to tell you\xfffeabout the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat created Unova.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease wait outside.
It is not the passage of time that\xfffecauses Pokémon and people to age.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen the energy that flows in their\xfffeheart dries up, that's when they get old.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe heart's energy is powered by\xfffetruth, ideals, or maybe dreams...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo doubt it changes depending on\xfffewhat you most hope for in life.

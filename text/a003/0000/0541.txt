I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow, I'm having a Triple Battle\xfffewith the opponent in front of me!
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wanted to get the attention of a girl\xfffeI like, so I mastered a new style of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battling called Triple Battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\xfffereally hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three\xfffePokémon at a time and battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe rules are simple: just make all of\xfffeyour opponent's Pokémon faint.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd that's a rough explanation\xfffeof Triple Battles.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\xfffeTriple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm always at full throttle.\xf000븁\x0000
I hate to burst your bubble when you're\xfffeall fired up, but...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn Triple Battles, you need three or\xfffemore Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have some advice for you.\xfffeChallenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting\xfffeschooled when I was planning to teach.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, you have potential!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou have to understand your Pokémon\xfffeto win in a Triple Battle.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRiding a bike and becoming the wind fits\xfffea bad boy like me.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow, I'm having a Rotation Battle\xfffewith the opponent in front of me!
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wanted to get the attention of a girl\xfffeI like, so I mastered a new style of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battling called Rotation Battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\xfffereally hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three\xfffePokémon at a time and battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOne Pokémon takes the lead position,\xfffeand the other two stand on each side.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe trick is, each turn you can change\xfffetheir positions...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd that's a rough explanation\xfffeof Rotation Battles.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\xfffeRotation Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm always at full throttle.\xf000븁\x0000

Am I going to lose to the heartbreaker?\xfffeI have a girlfriend!
You have four Gym Badges...\xfffeYou might be able to defeat Charles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease beat him for me!
Because it's a battle, one person has\xfffeto win and one person has to lose.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wish my boyfriend could just enjoy\xfffethe battle and not worry about losing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSometimes he gets too serious.
There seems to be a lot to think about,\xfffebut it looks really fun!
Battling with three Pokémon.\xfffeThat itself makes me very excited!
Triple Battle and\xfffeRotation Battle...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are various styles of\xfffePokémon battling.
The Trainer called Charles\xfffeis quite tough to beat.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have four Gym Badges,\xfffeyou might be a match for him.
There are so many different Pokémon,\xfffeit's difficult to decide which ones\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto battle with.
There are a lot of Pokémon.\xfffeSo I like this!
Looking at this kind of battle\xfffemakes me curious about the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon World Tournament.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI hear it will be held in Driftveil City.
Hi, Trainer! Will you buy the Berries\xfffeI gathered?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFive \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for just $200!\xfffeYou want them. You'll buy them, right?
Boo!\xfffeAnd I went to all that trouble\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto gather Berries.
Five \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for $200!\xfffeYou're a smart shopper!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! But your Bag is full!
Oh! But you don't have enough money.
I'll keep gathering Berries. Come back\xfffetomorrow if you want more!
I'll sell you five \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000\xfffefor just $200.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou want them. You'll buy them, right?
The drawbridge goes up\xfffewhen a ship needs to pass.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, the Pokémon that are resting\xfffeon the bridge fly away all at once!
Hum fiercely! My battle song!\xfffeBattle fiercely! My Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHuh?\xfffeYou don't have a Prop Case, do you?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThen I won't battle you!
Hum fiercely! My battle song!\xfffeBattle fiercely! My Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
In battling you, I came to understand...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're the best!\xfffeHere! This is for you!\xf000븁\x0000
If you want your Pokémon to\xfffehold this Electric Guitar,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffego to the Musical Theater!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCooler than cool!
In battling you, I came to understand...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're the best!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAfter all, you have the\xfffeElectric Guitar Prop!
In hot summer, I want to cool down\xfffewith Water-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOn the other hand, in cold winter,\xfffeI want to warm up with Fire-type Pokémon.
A Pokémon you are proud of\xfffewins with your favorite move!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's when a Trainer definitely smiles.
Bianca: Heeey!
Bianca: Hey!
Nice timing!\xfffeI was wanting to give you this!
Ta-da!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a Hidden Machine, Fly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you use this move outside of battle,\xfffeyou can go to places you want to go,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike a Pokémon Center.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffedo you know about Hidden Grottoes?

Great!\xfffeYou might find one soon!\xf000븁\x0000
OK! Then I'll explain!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes you can find a grotto\xfffeamong trees where Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike to hide.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat place is called a Hidden Grotto.\xfffeMakes sense, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Wait!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000
Over there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard something from that direction!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have good ears.\xfffeHey! Come with me!\xf000븁\x0000
The sound is coming from\xfffesomewhere around here.\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Here it is!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's a gap, and it looks like\xfffewe can fit through!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeC'mon! Let's go have a look!\xf000븁\x0000
Look!\xfffeYou've found a narrow path!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWill you follow it?
This is too good to pass up! Let's go in!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 5\xfffePerformer Street
Driftveil Drawbridge
Trainer Tips!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xfffeThere are different Cases\xfffefor each type of item.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeItems are placed automatically in\xfffethe correct Case by their type.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe name of the Case tells you\xfffewhat type of items will be kept there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, you can place anything in\xfffeFree Space, no matter what it is.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you can keep items you often use\xfffein one place.
Cheren: I heard that you met\xfffea Pokémon Trainer called N.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's not really why I'm here, though.\xfffeWill you battle me?
Cheren: There's something I want\xfffeto check by having a battle with you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about it?
You remind me of \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001.\xfffeThat makes me excited about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Not interested?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, I'll be here, so when you change\xfffeyour mind, please come battle me.
I talked with \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 here before.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe all have our own brand of strength,\xfffepeople and Pokémon both.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe strength to make our dreams\xfffea reality, the strength to protect\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat we hold most dear...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's what I said.\xf000븁\x0000
I was thinking about how I hope N can see\xfffethe same thing...but during our battle,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI came to understand something.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDuring his journey, N also saw\xfffewhat we saw.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I tell this story, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffewill probably be happy.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThank you!\xf000븁\x0000
You were great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCharles, too.\xfffeHe was great to some extent, I guess!\xf000븁\x0000
Three Pokémon!
Love!
Good, good, good.

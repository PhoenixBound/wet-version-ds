My house is just a little farther!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStop by the Pokémon Center\xfffefirst if you'd like!\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: Hey, this way!\xfffeShall we start training?\xf000븁\x0000
By the way...why are you\xfffeholding two Town Maps?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000
Oh ho!\xfffeIt's your friend's Town Map, is it?\xf000븁\x0000
Your friend is the one with\xfffethe \xf000ā\x0001\x0000, isn't he?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt just so happens, he was training\xfffehis Pokémon on Route 20...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, if that's the case, you should\xfffego give him the Town Map first!\xf000븁\x0000
Just follow this road.\xfffeIt goes to Route 20!\xf000븁\x0000
Just follow this road.\xfffeIt goes right to Route 20!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll be waiting here until you\xfffedeliver the Town Map!
Alder: Oh! It looks like you've\xfffedelivered the Town Map to your friend!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHrm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou were only gone a moment,\xfffebut you and your Pokémon have grown.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy, I could almost mistake you\xfffefor someone else!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then. Instead of training you,\xfffeI would like you and your Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto give me a hand!\xf000븁\x0000
Alder: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou know the Trainers' School\xfffeand Pokémon Gym that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewere just built in Aspertia?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI received notice that\xfffethe Gym Leader has arrived!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I have some advice for you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you want to see how much\xfffeyou understand your partners,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour Pokémon, then you should\xf000븀\x0000\xfffechallenge the Gym Leader!\xf000븁\x0000
In the morning, my Pokémon come\xfffeto wake me up when they're hungry.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt night, my Pokémon get tired\xfffefrom playing and take up the whole bed!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh! It fills me with so much joy!
You see, in Floccesy Ranch,\xfffewild Pokémon might surprise you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt times like that, only your\xfffeown Pokémon can help you out!
I always save a record of my adventure,\xfffeso I don't forget what I've done so far!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's a good idea for any Trainer!
People always think the past\xfffeor the future would be so wonderful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the great time we're\xfffespending with Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis right now!
Want to know what Alder taught me?
He said the Pokémon you throw out at\xfffethe start of battle is the one\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the upper-left slot in your party!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I put a Pokémon I want\xfffeto make stronger or a Pokémon that's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffealready tough in that spot!
You're being too bashful!\xfffeIt's a good opportunity! Ask away!
Are you happy you're\xfffeable to train Pokémon?
Right?!\xfffeMe too!
Huh? But you're traveling\xfffewith Pokémon!

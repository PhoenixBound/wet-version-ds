When you start a Funfest Mission,\xfffenearby adventurers can participate\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the same mission using the Tag Log\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon their C-Gear.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt may take some time before the mission\xfffeinvitations are received.

When you have participants in your\xfffeFunfest Mission, their actions also count\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas part of your score.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn a mission, items are found at the same\xfffelocation for everyone.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou may be able to talk to each other\xfffeto make missions easier for everybody.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOne more thing.

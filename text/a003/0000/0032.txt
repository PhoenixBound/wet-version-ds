I found a handkerchief.\xfffeI think one of our regulars dropped it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think that the customer had a brown\xfffePokémon that can use Super Fang...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm the kind of person who instantly\xfffeforgets about these kinds of things...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't mind, would you look\xfffefor the owner of this handkerchief?
Thank you!\xfffeI'll let you hang on to it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEvery day, we get a lot of different\xfffecustomers, so all ya gotta do is ask 'em!
Sniff...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI sure want to give this forgotten\xfffehandkerchief back to its owner...
I think it might have been the customer\xfffewho had a brown Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat can use Super Fang...
What? You found the customer\xfffewho lost his handkerchief?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was the person with Patrat, you say?\xfffeWhat a relief. Thank you so much!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, this is for you!\xf000븁\x0000
Work is so much fun!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, I get to meet so many\xfffepeople and Pokémon!
It's Monday! I'm drinking a Moomoo Milk\xfffeto get myself stoked up for the week!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt makes me feel like Krokorok and I\xfffeare both ready to take on another week!
Hm? Did I lose something?\xfffeNo, I don't think so...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI bet it was a customer on another day.
I always come here to relax with Lillipup\xfffeand look at lovely Fossils in the museum.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, my little Lillipup's\xfffespecialty is Roar.
What? No, I haven't lost anything.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy sweet Lillipup can't use\xfffeSuper Fang, either.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps it was another customer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMany people come to this café only\xfffeon a certain day.
Don't you think my Munna would\xfffebe a superstar if it was in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea Pokémon Musical?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's on the path to success, just like\xfffeme and my career as a Pokémon Trainer!
You're looking for someone\xfffewho lost something? Aren't you nice?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMunna isn't brown, though,\xfffeso it must be a different customer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think I might have seen someone with a\xfffebrown Pokémon on Thursday...
I always come to Café Warehouse\xfffeto relax after Patrat and I go\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor a jog in Pinwheel Forest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGetting a refreshing drink after\xfffeexercising is just the best! Right?
Huh?\xfffeDid I lose something?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! That handkerchief!\xfffeIt's mine!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000\xfffehanded over the Grubby Hanky!
Thank you so much for\xfffefinding that for me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI need that handkerchief so I can wipe\xfffePatrat's cheeks after it eats Berries.
Wa ha ha! My Watchog has nice fur!\xfffeDoesn't it look impressive?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI always come here to Café Warehouse\xfffeevery week and brag myself silly about it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIts Super Fang is super cool!
I haven't lost anything.\xfffeWatchog doesn't let anything get by it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure whatever it is belongs\xfffeto some other customer.
Taking it easy in the café on weekends\xfffemakes me forget the stress of workdays.
My! That handkerchief looks just like\xfffemine, but it belongs to someone else.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt does have a certain, hmm, ah,\xfffeje ne sais quoi about it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's with that look?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK. OK. It smells like a Patrat.
Sei jii!

Some things may be famous and good,\xfffebut some good things aren't famous.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat matters is whether you like them.\xfffeDon't you agree?
I've been getting really, really heavy,\xfffebut I just can't stop getting seconds.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWho was it?\xfffeWho used the move Encore on me?!
I like Nacrene's Café Warehouse\xfffeand Striaton's restaurant, too.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEach offers such different flavors!

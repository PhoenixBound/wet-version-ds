In the Unova region, there are eight\xfffePokémon Gyms and eight Gym Badges!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're a Trainer,\xfffeyou could collect all of them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat will make it easier to fill\xfffethe pages of the Pokédex as well!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, two years ago, Pokédex in hand,\xfffeI left on a journey with my friends.
Cheren: You should decide what\xfffeyou're going to do from here out!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't worry about losing your way--\xfffeyou have Pokémon by your side!
Cheren saw potential in me and\xfffemade me a Trainer in this Gym!\xf000븁\x0000
If you can defeat the girl, too,\xfffeyou can challenge the Gym Leader!
Wow! You can challenge\xfffethe Gym Leader!
The reason Cheren saw potential\xfffein me was there was no one else...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo way! Even if that is the case,\xfffeI just have to get stronger!

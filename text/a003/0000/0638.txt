You must be the ones who want to hear\xfffethat old tale about Lacunosa Town.\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: That's right.\xfffePlease tell us.\xf000븁\x0000
Behind Lacunosa Town,\xfffethere's a mighty big hole.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave you heard of the Giant Chasm?\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Oh, I've heard that around the\xfffeGiant Chasm, there have been brief\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetemperature readings of -58° F!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what Cheren told me, anyway!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: The road is blocked,\xfffeso we can't get there right now...\xf000븁\x0000
A long, long time ago, the\xfffeGiant Chasm was created when\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea big meteorite fell from the sky.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA really scary Pokémon was\xfffehidden inside that meteorite...\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: A meteorite...\xf000븁\x0000
When darkness falls over the land,\xfffethis Pokémon appears.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeA frigid wind follows it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt freezes everything around\xfffeand eats people and Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why everyone was afraid.\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: The Pokémon ate p-people?\xf000븁\x0000
So our ancestors surrounded the town\xfffewith walls, to prevent the Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom getting inside the town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, a rule was made forbidding\xfffeanyone to go outside after dark.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...And that's the end of the old tale!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: A fascinating story!\xfffeI'll add it to my research records.\xf000븁\x0000
Everyone, we should be going.\xf000븁\x0000
That's sure a scary-sounding Pokémon,\xfffeeven in an old folktale.
Zzz... Zzz...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Wh-what?\xfffeWhat do you want, now?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDid you pick now to listen to my stories?
Mmm... OK, I'll tell you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBehind our Lacunosa Town,\xfffethere's a big hole in the ground.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat hole, way in the past...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAaaahhh, I'm so tired...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat hole, there was a...a big...\xfffecrashed down...inside was...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffebig, scary...really scary...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeZzz...

My grandma loves old stories!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm always having to listen\xfffeto her really long stories.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut sometimes if it's night, she'll\xfffefall asleep right in the middle of a story.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's OK, though. She's not only healthy,\xfffeshe's a free-spirited grandma, too!

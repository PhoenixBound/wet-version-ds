Owner: Why did he get so mad?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think it's probably just\xfffeplaying somewhere in the ranch.\xf000븁\x0000
Wife: I wonder...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, dear, if your Pokémon\xfffeget hurt, let me know.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll make them feel better for you!

Wow, this ranch is really big!
Why haven't we found it yet?\xfffeI'm worried about Herdier...
Oh! Here! I'll share something\xfffegood with you!\xf000븁\x0000
If your Pokémon is paralyzed,\xfffeuse one of these on it!\xf000븁\x0000
Still, Pokémon don't just wander\xfffeoff on their own.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn a worst-case scenario,\xfffeit might be involved in some trouble!
Yawrp!
Did you hear that just now?\xf000븁\x0000
I'll check this area!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou go deeper in the grove\xfffeand look!\xf000븁\x0000

That's right! We're the righteous group\xfffethat tried to conquer Unova two years\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeback in order to liberate Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Really? We're the righteous group\xfffethat tried to conquer Unova two years\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeback in order to liberate Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Whatever...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFools will never understand us...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst I got lost chasing Herdier...\xfffeand now some nosy kid caught me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll of this is your fault!\xfffeTake this!\xf000븁\x0000

Owner: Hmm...\xfffeI wonder if something happened to him...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's like he's afraid of\xfffelosing Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCome on, Herdier!\xfffeEveryone's waiting! Let's go home!\xf000븁\x0000
Owner: Thanks! It's all thanks\xfffeto you and your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're really great! Hey, is that it?\xfffeDid Alder train you?
This ranch started when a fence\xfffewas made to protect Pokémon!
Owner: It is strange for Herdier\xfffeto wander off on its own.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt always plays with the other\xfffeone or works on the ranch...
Yup! You and your Pokémon\xfffeare full of energy!
You and your Pokémon\xfffelook a little worn out...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRest here a minute--you won't\xfffeget anywhere all tired like that!\xf000븁\x0000

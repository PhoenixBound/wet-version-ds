A long, long time ago...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTornadus and Thundurus\xfffestarted a rampage in Therian Forme.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen everybody thought the Unova region\xfffewould be ruined and gave up hope,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLandorus, also in Therian Forme,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeappeared out of nowhere\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand stopped them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what they say.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! Hey!\xfffeWait a second.\xf000븁\x0000
This has been placed in the shrine.\xfffeTake this.\xf000븁\x0000
They say the Reveal Glass brings\xfffeThundurus, Tornadus, and Landorus\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeback to their original appearance.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I don't know whether\xfffeIncarnate Forme or Therian Forme\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis the true Forme.\xf000븁\x0000
Why do delicious vegetables grow in the\xfffefields of Mistralton City?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's because the ones who grow them are\xfffevery picky about the mulch they use.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's good mulch. Strong mulch. It's\xfffestored up a lot of energy from nature.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd that makes it really stinky!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch a powerful aroma! It burns\xfffeall the way to the back of your nose!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAww. Just remembering it\xfffemakes me dizzy!\xf000븁\x0000

I want Pokémon to be\xfffein the new office...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I can't say such a thing\xfffein front of my girlfriend.
Even before Poké Balls were created,\xfffepeople and Pokémon were good friends.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI wonder if this relationship will last\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the future, too.
Missing Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if Team Plasma is responsible,\xfffewe don't know where they are.
I learned some Pokémon want to\xfffebe with Trainers...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, some Pokémon prefer\xfffeto live wild.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor your information, I heard\xfffePokémon who have learned a hidden move\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemay come back, even if you try to\xf000븀\x0000\xffferelease them.
My Pokémon...\xfffeWhere did it go...?
My Pokémon!\xfffeScraggy came back!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know if it was held captive\xfffeby Team Plasma...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeor it was lost and came back by itself...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut anyway, I'm happy!
Gyscragg!

\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: This ship...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy is it so cold?\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: And...\xf000븁\x0000
It seems like it's disguised\xfffeas an old sailboat...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut that can't be it, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Why should you care?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the time we're done with you,\xfffeit won't matter anyway!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You guys...\xfffeSeriously, this is Team Plasma's base?\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Correct answer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo that's why, as you can see...\xf000븁\x0000
There are so many of us here!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Is this all?\xfffeI think you need more backup.\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Ha ha ha! Oooh, I'm\xfffeso scared, big tough guy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK!\xfffePulverize these punks!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlasmaaaa!\xf000븁\x0000

Team Plasma: You're first!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Next! Next!\xfffeHurry up already!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Go! Go!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomebody avenge me\xfffeand take these guys out!
Team Plasma: It's my turn!\xfffeActually, it's Trubbish time!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: What's with this Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis reminds me of that Trainer who\xfffemessed with us two years ago...\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: What's with this Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis reminds me of that Trainer who\xfffemessed with us two years ago...
Team Plasma: Tch!\xfffeIt's two against one now!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'd like to show them what the two of us\xfffecan do, so could you help me out?\xf000븁\x0000

Team Plasma: Hey, I remember you!\xfffeYou're gonna pay for Virbank!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou and the Gym Leader are going\xfffedown, so you'd better brace yourself!
Team Plasma: The Gym Leader is\xfffeirritating, but you...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou are a horrible little brat!
Team Plasma: This guy...\xfffeMore than strong, he's scary!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHe's really cheesed off!
Team Plasma: Look around you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSee how many of us there are?\xfffeJust surrender already!
Team Plasma: Ooogz...\xfffeStrong for such a little brat!
Team Plasma: That little punk\xfffewas too intense!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEspecially for someone whose head\xfffelooks like a Qwilfish!
Team Plasma: You guys are too intense!
Team Plasma: I'm not losing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, actually, I haven't\xfffereceived a Pokémon yet!
Team Plasma: What's this?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre the Gym Leaders\xfffegoing to interfere with us again?
Team Plasma: I didn't stand a chance...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I bullied--I mean trained--my\xfffePokémon for two whole years, too!
Team Plasma: Sniff...\xfffeOur plans might fail again...
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: This is a piece of cake!\xfffeGo back up Cheren!
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm gonna end this,\xfffeso back me up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK, Plasma punk, are YOU the thief\xfffewho stole a Purrloin in Aspertia\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefive years back?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's the last of 'em!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell now... Why don't you tell me\xfffeeverything you know about Purrloin?\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Good idea...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are a lot of things I want\xfffeto ask about as well.\xf000븁\x0000
???: What is going on?\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Oh, good grief...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're the person who was\xfffeshivering in the Cold Storage, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWasn't your name Zinzolin?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're going to have to tell me what\xfffeyou're planning to do with this ship.\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: YOU!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnce again, we will use the\xfffelegendary Dragon-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand we will rule the Unova region!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCurious Trainers, we shall not\xfffelet you run around as you please!\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad!\xfffeGet them out of here!\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: By the way,\xfffewe are not your...\xf000븁\x0000
Zinzolin: I know!\xfffeBut kick them out of here now!\xf000븁\x0000
Shadow Triad: Move.\xf000븁\x0000
The hatch is closed tightly.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Take care of that guy!\xfffeHe's no problem for you, right?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm fine...\xfffeLet's try to find a way inside.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: OK!\xfffeThis time we'll check out the ship!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen we were in Driftveil City,\xfffeZinzolin came from this direction!\xf000븁\x0000
This is the place...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK! I'm going!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey!\xfffeCome here for a sec!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: You!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou must be friends of Smiley Swimsuit,\xfffethat guy who lowered the gangplank!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAaargh! You even got the roadblock\xfffeCrustle out of the way!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere I come!\xfffePlasmaaaa!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Oh no!\xfffeThe hatch is still open!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: I don't know anything\xfffeabout your Purrloin or whatever!
Zzz...\xfffeZzz...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLooks like he's asleep.
Team Plasma: The sky sure is vast.
Team Plasma: I knew...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI knew that Ghetsis\xfffewas using me...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I had friends here...
Intruders!
For now, let them through!
Don't try to get out of your\xfffewatch with stupid talk like that!
And, um, did you find the swimsuit\xfffeguy who lowered the gangplank?
Even the same Pokémon\xfffecan exhibit different strengths\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedepending on the Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's so interesting!\xfffeVery, very interesting!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, now!\xfffeGive me but a moment of your time!
The invisible force that exists between\xfffeyou and Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis time I will determine what it is!\xf000븁\x0000
And I went to all the\xfffetrouble to come here, too...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou're an unkind person.
Well, now!\xfffeGive me but a moment of your time!
The things you and your Pokémon\xfffehave seen and felt...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo they belong to you and you alone?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you would, please have another\xfffePokémon battle with me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy facing you, I feel as if I can see\xfffewhat I should do from now on.
Hey!
You're kidding!
This is no good...
What should we do?

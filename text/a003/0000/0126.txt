Hi there, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
It's nice to finally be able\xfffeto talk to you in person!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm Professor Juniper!\xf000븁\x0000
You accepted the Pokédex and\xfffecame all the way out here with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour partners...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, I'll evaluate your progress\xfffefor you!\xf000븁\x0000
So, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, you've seen\xfffe\xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0001 Pokémon up to this point!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI see! Thank you!\xfffeThis is a token of my gratitude.\xf000븁\x0000
Juniper: This Master Ball is the most\xfffepowerful kind of Poké Ball.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt can catch any Pokémon without fail.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJourneys are about meeting Pokémon.\xfffeDon't let a chance get away!\xf000븁\x0000
Still, I'm amazed how much Pokémon\xfffedistribution changes in two years.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means my research will never end.\xfffeStill, you could say that's what\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemakes it fun...\xf000븁\x0000
???: Professor Juniperrrrr!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Why, if it isn't Skyla!\xf000븁\x0000
This is Skyla.\xfffeShe's Mistralton City's Gym Leader.\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Why are you surprised, Professor?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou did ask for a lift in my plane to\xfffecross Twist Mountain, since you can't\xf000븀\x0000\xfffereach Opelucid City by foot.\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Aha ha! You're right.\xfffeBut I have a quick favor to ask first.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want a look at Celestial Tower.\xfffeDo you mind waiting till I'm through?\xf000븁\x0000
See you, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBe sure to always get along\xfffewith all kinds of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Honestly! I can't tell if she's\xfffejust laid back or if she's not paying\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeattention to anything outside her head.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe apple sure doesn't\xfffefall far from the tree.\xf000븁\x0000
What's next?\xfffeAre you coming to my Gym to challenge me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr are you going to follow the professor\xfffeto Celestial Tower and do some training?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs long as I get to battle with a strong\xfffeTrainer, I'm fine either way!\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Time for a quick hop in my plane!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey, where did Professor Juniper get to?\xf000븁\x0000
I wonder if she's still doing research\xfffein Celestial Tower?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMmm... Could I ask you\xfffeto go get the professor?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've got to finish flight preparations\xfffeat Mistralton Cargo Service!\xf000븁\x0000
Professor Juniper: Hi there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope we can get some good\xffferesearch done on the other side\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof the mountain as well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! I want you to\xfffetake this flight, too!\xf000븁\x0000
There's someone I want you to\xfffemeet in Opelucid City,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut we can't get through\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTwist Mountain right now.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe'll just make a quick flight\xfffeover to Lentimas Town!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll be waiting for you in\xfffeMistralton Cargo Service!\xf000븁\x0000
Skyla: Hey! Professor! Wait up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHonestly... She just does\xfffeeverything at her own pace!\xf000븁\x0000
OK! You come, too!\xf000븁\x0000
We've arranged it so Mistralton's planes\xfffeare now available for passenger service.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's not like everyone's Pokémon\xfffecan use Fly!
Fly is an amazing move!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven a teeny-weeny Pokémon\xfffecan carry a person easily!
That Skyla...\xfffeShe's even surpassed her grandpa,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho was a legendary pilot!
Mistralton City used to be a\xfffedesolate patch of land...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis place was built through the\xfffecooperation of people and Pokémon.
Planes need a runway to fly,\xfffebut Pokémon don't need a thing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut planes can carry a lot more\xfffecargo than Pokémon can.
Team Plasma went after certain\xfffePokémon, like Purrloin!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMany people had their Pokémon stolen.\xfffeThat's just unforgivable!
If you want to eat delicious vegetables,\xfffethe ones grown in the wild are the best.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes they are eaten by Pokémon...\xfffeAh, I mean we can give them to Pokémon.
Vegetables grown efficiently\xfffein a greenhouse are the best.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTheir nutrients all go into forming\xfffea very delicious vegetable!
Oh! You found our treasure!\xf000븁\x0000
Found it!\xf000븁\x0000
Just kidding!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOur Ducklett already knows Aerial Ace.\xfffeSo we'll give you this TM!\xf000븁\x0000
Just kidding!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOur Ducklett already knows Aerial Ace.\xfffeSo we'll give you this TM!\xf000븁\x0000
Aerial Ace always hits its target!\xfffeI hope it comes in handy!\xf000븁\x0000
Kwa!
See you! Bye-bye!\xf000븁\x0000
Hey, what's up?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI know! Since you're here,\xfffeI'll tell you a little secret!\xf000븁\x0000
Please keep this a secret from Elesa, OK?
Know what?\xfffeMy Pokémon loves Berries!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'm wandering all over,\xfffelooking for Berries!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI dream about a wonderful city somewhere\xfffethat is overflowing with Berries...\xf000븁\x0000
The Funfest Mission\xfffe“\xf000ŀ\x0001\x0000"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehas been added to the Entralink.
My Pokémon's favorite\xfffeBerry is the Leppa Berry!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt restores PP!\xfffeIsn't it a useful Berry?
Do you know the big street\xfffecalled \xf000Ĺ\x0001\x0000?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are a lot of unique shops there!\xfffeIt's so cool!

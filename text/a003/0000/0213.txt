Cheren: Hey, nice timing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard that Team Plasma was seen\xfffein Pinwheel Forest...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould you help me look for them?
We don't know how many there are,\xfffeso splitting up doesn't seem like\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea very good tactic.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGot it! I'll wait here until\xfffeyou're ready to go!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a good opportunity for me\xfffeto see up close what you can really do.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI suppose I'll follow your lead.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLeave recovery to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Stop!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you go past here, we'll leave\xfffethe Pinwheel Forest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe still haven't found Team Plasma,\xfffebut do you need to leave for a minute?
Cheren: Team Plasma was seen inside\xfffePinwheel Forest...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut you already know that.\xfffeWill you help me look for them?
People and Pokémon\xfffeeach have their own strengths--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe strength to realize dreams,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand the strength to protect others...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure N understands that now.
Team Plasma...\xfffeOr better said, Ghetsis...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's almost like, to him, there was\xfffenothing else in the world but himself...
My ideal is to be strong...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut there are many ways to be strong\xfffein this world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSimply winning battles doesn't help\xfffeme find the ideal strength I desire.
You remind me of a friend of mine\xfffewhose strength was amazing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what that friend\xfffeis up to these days...
Still no sign of Team Plasma. Why don't we\xfffehead deeper into the forest?
                                                                                            
                                                                            
Gorm: Boo!\xf000븁\x0000
I am Gorm. I was once one\xfffeof Team Plasma's Seven Sages.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Team Plasma's finished.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDespite that, you still haven't given up?\xfffeAre you here planning something?\xf000븁\x0000
Gorm: Wait one moment!\xfffeI have no plans to confront you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't mean to disappoint you,\xfffebut I doubt I'm a match for either\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof you in the first place...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHm?\xfffeWhat happened to your glasses?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeExcuse me, but that's not important.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI learned of my old ally's recklessness,\xfffeand I had come here to admonish him...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the matter had already been\xffferesolved, and this place made me think...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat did we believe in that made\xfffeus try to steal the Dragon Skull?\xf000븁\x0000
A man who has committed a mistake\xfffeand doesn't correct it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis committing another mistake.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you understand what this means?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAvoiding all mistakes is impossible,\xfffebut not fixing mistakes you've made--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat is truly foolish.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat being said, this doesn't\xfffereally concern you, does it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then, Trainers, may you and your\xfffePokémon be well.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: You know...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf it wasn't for Ghetsis,\xfffehe might've chosen another path...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr maybe not. He was the one who\xfffedecided to follow Ghetsis, after all...\xf000븁\x0000
That aside, thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour help made this\xfffeinvestigation go smoothly.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is my thanks!\xfffeCome on, just take it!\xf000븁\x0000
OK! Be seeing you!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going to do a lap around Unova\xfffeclockwise from Nimbasa City\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewithout healing my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's the Unova Spartan Marathon,\xfffeand next time, I'm going to race!
We're thinning trees to\xfffeprotect the forest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why we're having Pokémon\xfffecut down trees.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen there are too many trees,\xfffethe whole forest gets weaker...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThese trees are being cut down\xfffeso the whole forest will thrive...
Ah, wouldn't it be nice if the Pokémon\xfffeliving in the forest liked the sunbeams\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefiltering through the leaves, too!
Hi, Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have a Pokédex, could you show me\xfffeyour Habitat List?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to know about the Pokémon\xfffethat live in Pinwheel Forest.\xf000븁\x0000
You still have many meetings\xfffewaiting for you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTell me when you've encountered\xfffeall of the Pokémon in Pinwheel Forest.
Perfect!\xfffeThis is my thanks!\xf000븁\x0000
Finding the Pokémon that can\xfffeonly be found in the rustling grass\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis really amazing!
The legendary Pokémon...\xfffeIs it true it was really beyond here?
The surface is covered with moss.\xfffeTouching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xfffeA forest is likely to contain many\xfffewell-hidden items!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey may be hard to find,\xfffeso look carefully!

The one you meet when you get on this\xfffeconveyor is none other than me!\xf000븁\x0000
Have you used the elevator?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you get on the elevator,\xfffeyou can figure out where you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehaven't been, right?
Just because you work hard doesn't\xfffemean you're gonna get what you want!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if you don't work hard,\xfffethere are many things you can't do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me show you how tough\xfffemy hard work has made me!\xf000븁\x0000

Isn't darkness great?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's the space of dreams where\xfffeyou don't know what's even there!
When I say dig,\xfffeyou say, “How low?"\xf000븁\x0000
Life is filled with pitfalls!\xfffeIf you fall in, do your best to crawl out!

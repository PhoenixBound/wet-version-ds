Lenora: Why hello, Burgh.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's up?\xfffeSuffering from artist's block again?\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Hmm...\xfffeBones, perhaps...\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: Bones...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a museum,\xfffeso of course we have bones.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat are you looking for?\xfffeYour next motif?\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Maybe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr maybe not...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMany Bug-type Pokémon have\xfffehard coverings, right?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTheir so-called exoskeletons.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I don't quite understand bones.\xfffeNot at all, actually.\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: So, did you think you would\xfffeunderstand something about bones\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeif you came here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSure thing!\xfffeMake yourself at home!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you'd like, I can have my husband\xfffeexplain them to you.\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Mmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, for starters, what do bones\xfffemean to you?\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: When I was little, my dad\xfffeworked in a mine, and he would always\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebring home bones he dug up.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was just a child, but I was brought\xfffeunder the spell of bones.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat did the bones look like\xfffewhen they were part of a living being?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy are they shaped the way they are?\xfffeThings like that captivated me.\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Oohhh...\xfffeI kind of understand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm also fascinated by the functional,\xfffeefficient designs of Bug-type Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesuch as the shape of their legs.\xf000븁\x0000
???: Hey there!\xfffeWhat's everyone all gathered up for?\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: What brings you here?\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: Found a Fossil\xfffein Twist Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI came to have Lenora look at it and see\xfffeif ya wanted to keep it here or somethin'.\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Clay.\xfffeWhat do bones mean to you?\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: Hmm?\xfffeWell now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo matter who ya are or when ya die,\xfffebones are all that'll be left of ya.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen ya think about it, it's amazin'.\xfffeEven if ya die, ya can make money!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSome Fossils are worth a lot, ya know!\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: I can't tell if you're kidding,\xfffebut of course you would think that way.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBurgh is trying hard to think\xfffeabout what bones mean to him.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't be so flippant!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo what kind of Fossil have you got\xfffethere? Let me see.\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: Here ya go!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhaddaya think?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's gotta be worth a mint\xfffeas a specimen or as a collectible!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhich is it?\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: Well, I mean this in a good way,\xfffebut it's an ordinary Fossil.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf it isn't worth much as a specimen,\xfffeyou can't sell it for much.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I'm curious about the soil\xfffeattached to the Fossil...\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: What do you mean?\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: It's very subtle,\xfffebut it's a bit different from the soil\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI usually see from Twist Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000
Clay: That so?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGuess my Twist Mountain\xfffestill has unlimited potential!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll right!\xfffeI'll keep on diggin' my Clay Tunnel!\xf000븁\x0000
Here, Burgh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat plain ol' Fossil's yours!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave a look at it\xfffeand think about what bones mean to ya.\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: Thank you, Lenora.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess it's OK that I have\xfffemy own perspective on what\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebones mean to me, right?\xf000븁\x0000
Lenora: Why not?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou, me, Clay...\xfffeWe all have a different way of thinking\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeabout what bones mean to us.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt would be kind of creepy if we all felt\xfffethe exact same way, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnyway, I feel sorry for this Fossil.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's just resting, minding its own\xfffebusiness, and everyone is saying\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis and that about it.\xf000븁\x0000
Burgh: I know.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll thank this Fossil\xfffeby using it as a motif\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor one of my works.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSee you, Lenora.\xf000븁\x0000

Don't ignore Pokémon's feelings\xfffeand separate them from their Trainers!
Is this where you come to an\xfffeunderstanding by trading blows?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis is what being young is, right?
That traitorous Sage!\xfffeI'm going to pound him into a pulp!

What you're doing now is nothing\xfffemore than a futile struggle!

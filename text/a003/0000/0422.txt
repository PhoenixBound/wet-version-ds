My great-great-great-grandfather and\xfffehis Gurdurr worked together and built\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis Village Bridge.
I'll be a stonecutter like my grandpa!\xfffeI can get help from powerful Pokémon!
If Team Plasma had tricked everyone\xfffeinto releasing all their Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit would have been impossible\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto build a bridge like this.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople and Pokémon are inseparable...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe relationship is not more or less\xfffethan that. That's what I believe.

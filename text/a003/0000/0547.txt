I've been searching for the legendary\xfffePokémon Cobalion for decades...
Oh! It's...\xfffeIt's Cobalion!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow I understand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou were able to show it that\xfffethere are humans and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat understand one another\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand help each other out!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut it's not just humans and Pokémon...\xfffeAll living things must accept\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand trust each other.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the best way to look at it.
I wonder if it still hates humans.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr...maybe it looks at this world\xfffewhere Pokémon and people coexist\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand has thoughts about it...

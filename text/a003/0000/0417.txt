Hello! If you cross the Skyarrow Bridge\xfffefrom here, you'll reach Castelia City.
They say the Skyarrow Bridge was built\xfffeas a result of the tireless pursuit\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof a safe and sturdy structure.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what kind of Pokémon built it\xfffeand how they felt while building it.
Use Fly, and you'll be there in no time!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut some people prefer to cross\xfffethat bridge to go to Castelia City.

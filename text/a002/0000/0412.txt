...Clunk!\xfffe...CLANG! Rumble-rumble-rumble!
Eeeek! Let me off! It's gonna break!!\xfffeDaddy! Mommy! Save meee!
Oh! It's going higher and higher!\xfffeBoy...this takes me back...
Oh! Look at that over there!\xfffeIt's absolutely stunning...
Wow... That's right...\xfffeIt was like that then, too...
Phew... It's so muggy.\xfffeI shouldn't have worn my apron.
Sweat is making my clothes stick to me...\xfffeI'll be fine. Check out the scenery.
Yeeesh...\xfffeI'm completely drenched in sweat...
...Clunk!\xfffe...CLANG! Rumble-rumble-rumble!
Good grief! This ride is worn out...\xfffeI just don't get what's fun about this...
So bored... Well, this'll be the last\xfffeI'll see of this view for a while...
The look of the town doesn't change...\xfffeBut I do, I guess...
Hee hee... My baby's kicking.\xfffeMaybe it's enjoying the view, too...
Hee hee hee... My little one\xfffeis sure moving. Must be having fun...
It was...two years ago...in summer.\xfffeI felt... It was...
Sniff... That's right...\xfffeI'm sure... But...
Said I like you... It was a lie!\xfffeIt wasn't... Sniff...
I wonder if other people look at\xfffeus and think we're a couple.
Don't move from that spot.\xfffeBe still... Just like that...
Looking out the window seems dangerous.\xfffeJust look straight at me...
Footprints left on snow-covered ground\xfffeare all I have left to remember you by. ♪
Ghost, oh my Ghost-type daaarling...\xfffeYou can't feel my Normal-type touch! ♪
We're finished. We've reached an impasse.\xfffeYou're colder than a winter Froslass! ♪
Well, it's good to do something like\xfffethis and relax every now and again.
Wow! Awesome!\xfffeWe're so high up!
Well...\xfffeThat was kinda fun.
Huuuh? Was that...\xfffeHmm... Maybe I got it wrong...
Wow!\xfffeThis is sooo neat!!
Maybe...\xfffeI got a little overexcited.
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001You...\xffferemind me of that Trainer.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001Now that I think about it,\xfffewe both rode this Ferris wheel, too.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001Making dreams come true is hard...\xfffeI wonder if we will meet again...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
I don't really get what's so fun about\xffferiding the Ferris wheel.
That's the Skyarrow Bridge, and\xfffethat's Pinwheel Forest over there.
Maybe I enjoyed that a little bit. I\xfffeguess I still need to work on having fun.
Ah. Umm...\xfffeI'm a little nervous for some reason...
It's strange...\xfffeTalking with you makes me feel so happy...
That's why I wanted to meet you\xfffein person...and say thank you.
It's just the two of us.
When I'm with you,\xfffeI feel so relaxed somehow.
I can finally thank you!
I never get tired of this view.
Is it because I'm with you?
Aww...\xfffeIt's over already...
The Unova region sure is pretty,\xfffeisn't it?
But it's not the only thing that's\xfffepretty around here.
I wish the whole world could go slower.\xfffeThis Ferris wheel... Time...

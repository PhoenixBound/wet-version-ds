Director: I want acting just like\xfffedat in da next scene, too!
Director: Oh!\xfffeLet's keep going like dis!
Director: I can see dat\xfffeworking for dat line.
Director: Dat last line...\xfffeIt's passable, I guess.
Director: Dat last line...\xfffeDat was pretty dreadful.
Director: What are you doing?\xfffeWe'll run out of film!
Director: Cut!\xfffeDat might not be bad!
Director: Cut! Enough!\xfffeDat's it for today!

Director: Dat acting right now!\xfffeYou're getting really good!
Director: Hmm... I see.\xfffeDis scene is like dat.

Director: I don't have any complaints\xfffeabout da angle you suggest.
Director: Oh, I see!\xfffeI'm learning from you!
Director: Your acting...\xfffeIt brings such an intensity to da room.
Director: When you act, it makes\xfffeeveryone else's acting look good, too!
Director: OK! I'm going to leave dis\xfffeto you and just let da cameras roll!
Director: Dat last line\xfffewas really well acted...
Director: I think dat\xfffelast line was fine.
Director: Dat last line\xfffereally wasn't too great.
Director: What's wrong?!\xfffeWrap things up cleanly!

Director: Cut! Hm... You have to\xfffeget better. Devote yourself to acting!
Director: C-cut!\xfffeDis shoot...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just don't get what happened...

Veteran Star
Assistant
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffePlease be careful!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I can't believe\xfffethat the fate of my research is being\xf000븀\x0000\xfffejeopardized by a pair of glasses!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Still...\xfffeThose are some incredibly flashy glasses...
Strange: That's what makes them great!\xfffeI'm very particular about my glasses!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Argh...\xfffeThis isn't good!
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeIf this keeps up, the temporal transport\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis going to blow!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It's finally time!\xfffeTime to venture into the future with my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffenew invention--the temporal transport!
Strange: When you first told me to make\xfffeit small enough to fit inside a capsule the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesize of a person's hand, I thought you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewere asking the impossible, but somehow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewe managed to pull it off!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've been looking forward to this moment,\xfffeProfessor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It's time...\xfffeActivate the temporal transport!
Strange: All that's left is to charge\xfffeup the Pokémon move power...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWait! What's this?!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What happened?!
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001...\xfffeI hate to say this, but it appears that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy glasses are stuck in part of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe temporal transport!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we activate it now, it will\xfffecertainly malfunction!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Your glasses?!
Strange: Perhaps we could use a Pokémon\xfffemove to dislodge my glasses...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeProfessor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001! Please try\xfffeto recover my glasses!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Certainly!
Strange: Thank you so much!\xfffeI knew it wouldn't be a problem for you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease get them back. Those glasses are\xfffevery important to me!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Forget it!
Strange: But Professor, that could\xfffeend up causing serious complications!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Oh no! They're beginning to throw sparks!\xfffeMy glasses!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Your mistake!
Strange: That may be so, but have some\xfffecompassion, Professor!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBesides, it's entirely possible that this\xfffeonly happened due to a flaw in your design!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDon't put all the blame on me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Oh no! The electricity is shorting out!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I wonder...\xfffeIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: Temporal transport should\xfffestill be possible!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Are you sure?\xfffeI'm a little worried about all that smoke\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecoming out of it...
Strange: It should be fine!\xfffeThat's just steam from the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecoolant water!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hah!\xfffeSuch minor complications are well within\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy expectations!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeContinue the experiment, Strange!
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeLet's do it! We have the power!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I wonder...\xfffeIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: I'm getting some very\xfffepeculiar power readings...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis could be extremely dangerous!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: We should be OK!\xfffeIt wouldn't be an experiment without some\xf000븀\x0000\xffferisk taking! It makes it even more exciting!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis will surely be an\xfffeelectrifying experience!
Strange: The only thing electrifying is\xfffethis temporal transport! It's discharging\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike crazy!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I wonder...\xfffeIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: Hmm...\xfffeIt looks like the temporal transport may\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebe overheating. I wouldn't say it's in the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemost stable condition...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: So what?\xfffeNo risk, no reward! I'm burning\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith excitement!
Strange: That's all well and good, but\xfffewhat will we do if the temporal transport\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecatches on fire?
Strange: We've done it, Professor!\xfffeThe temporal transport is functioning\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeproperly! And my glasses are safe and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesound, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn just moments, a gate into the future\xfffewill open before us!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Excellent!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen I will be on my way to visit\xfffethe world of the future!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll bring you a souvenir!\xfffeExpect something cool!
Strange: I will!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease, return safely, Professor!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Soon now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTemporal transport activation...go!
Strange: Good luck,\xfffeProfessor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!
And thus, I ventured into the world\xfffeof the future with the time machine\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI invented myself--the temporal transport!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs I look back on these events,\xfffeI wonder if it might have been better\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeif my experiment had failed...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's this?
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeThe temporal transport system is\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeout of control!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Could my\xfffeexperiment have failed?
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeGet away from the temporal transport!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's going to explode!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Aaahhh!
Strange: Professor!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ugh...argh...
Strange: Professor! Professor!\xfffeAre you OK?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Urghh...\xfffeI can't believe I made it through...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWe'll have to start all over now...
Strange: Uhh...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?\xfffeWhat's the matter?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan't you see? I'm just fine!\xfffeAnnoyed that the experiment failed, but fine\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeall the same. I won't give up so easily!
Strange: Umm... Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou'd better have a look at this...
When I gazed into the mirror Strange\xfffehanded me, I was at a loss for words...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere in the mirror, I saw...not myself,\xfffebut a very peculiar creature instead.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps it was a side effect of the energy\xfffethat leaked out of the temporal transport,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut I had somehow become merged with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000, who had been at my side.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis, of course, marked the end\xfffeof my research...
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeThe energy will not stop discharging!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Wait! What's happening?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe temporal transport appears to be\xfffefunctioning properly...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You worry too much!\xfffeIf the temporal transport is functioning,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen there isn't a problem!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd now it's time for me to venture\xfffeinto the world of the future!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOff I go!
Strange: But, Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffePlease, wait a moment!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt can't be! I'm detecting an eruption of\xfffetachyon particles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeProfessor! You must stop!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I care not!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTemporal-transport activation...go!
Strange: Professor, no!\xfffeProfess...or! Stop...now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...
Ignoring my assistant's pleas, I stepped\xfffeinto the gate, not knowing how soon I would\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecome to regret it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was just as Strange said. The\xfffetemporal transport was not functioning\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeproperly. Instead of stepping into the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefuture, I was warped 100 million years\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto the past...
Not only that, but with the temporal\xfffetransport broken down, and with no means\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto fix it in these ancient times, I am stuck\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeforever in the past, unable to return...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe it's not so bad to live in a world\xfffewhere I can see ancient Pokémon, the likes\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof which I had only seen in Fossil museums...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAt least, that's what I keep telling myself.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hmmm...\xfffeI guess it just won't work...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow unfortunate. I heard this move could\xfffetranscend time.
Strange: Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrying to bend time and space with a\xfffePokémon move instead of using the temporal\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetransport is just shameful! That's not\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehow a proper scientist should behave!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You think so?\xfffeI kind of hoped it would work...
Strange: Seriously?\xfffeUgh... Just do whatever you want...

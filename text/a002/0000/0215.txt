Future Being
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I wonder if I'll\xfffeever be able to make it back home...
Ledian: I'll show you that the future\xfffebelongs to us Bug-type Pokémon!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Gah...\xfffeNot enough energy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI need electric energy that's as powerful\xfffeas a thunderbolt!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It's not easy to\xfffego back to the past from the future.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt takes a lot more energy than it does\xfffeto come from the past into the future...
Ledian: I won't let you!

Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Stop!\xfffeIf all you wanted was the temporal\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetransport, then you don't need me anymore!
Ledian: That's right.\xfffeI have no more need for you...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's why I am going to eliminate you...
Black Belt: Temporal transport...\xfffeLook likes a Human Ball?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLedian has it...\xfffeMakes me go back to Ball...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThen, temporal transport comes out...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Black Belt, thank\xfffeyou. I feel like I understand.
Ledian: Black Belt... Are you so worthless\xfffea human that you can't follow even the most\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebasic of orders?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWorthlessness is a crime...\xfffeI'll eliminate you all...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'll show you what\xfffehumans are really made of...
Ledian: I don't understand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe existence of you humans is only\xfffevalidated when you're used by us\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBug-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can't do anything on your own.\xfffeSuch an immature life-form...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: We may not be\xfffestrong on our own, but that's why we\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehelp each other out.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have my assistant, Strange, as well\xfffeas \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI also have the help of Black Belt!
Ledian: Silence!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can't even fly into the sky\xfffeor spin a string!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou can't shoot powerful beams\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeor evolve into stronger forms!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd you've only got two arms...
Ledian: Just who do you think you are\xfffeanyway? You think it's OK to come into\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe future like this and just go back home?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou think it's OK to come into our world,\xfffetake whatever you please, and then return\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto your own era at your own convenience?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't think so!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: But...
Ledian: Or perhaps you thought that\xfffethe future would be an even better place\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor you humans?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's only because of humans in the past like\xfffeyou, who did whatever they pleased, that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis world turned out like it did...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIdiotic humans... How can you be so naive?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: No! It's not true...
Ledian: Hmph...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo matter... Us Bug-type Pokémon are\xfffethankful for the mistakes you humans made.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's all thanks to you that we came to\xfffecontrol the future!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: All your fault!
Ledian: There you go again...\xfffeAlways blaming other people for your\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeown mistakes...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm not a person, though...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOuch! That hurts!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's going on?\xfffeWhat is this powerful energy coming out\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof the capsule your time machine is in?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You're wrong!
Ledian: You humans are all the same...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlways averting your gaze from reality\xfffewhen it's not convenient...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAlways denying what you know is true...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOuch! It's so cold!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's going on?\xfffeSome strange coolant gas is seeping out\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof the capsule your time machine is in...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'll change it!
Ledian: Hah!\xfffeAs if you could...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course you can't...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Wait a second. You managed to create a\xfffetime machine when even us Bug-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecouldn't... Could it be possible that you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave the power to change the future?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOuch! That's hot!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's going on?\xfffeThis capsule that your time machine is in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis starting to heat up...
Ledian: It's so bright...\xfffeIt's burning my eyes...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh no...\xfffeIf the energy keeps pouring out of my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetemporal transport like this,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit might explode!
Ledian: What?!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: After storing up\xfffeso much energy, if my temporal transport\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewere to explode now, it could quite possibly\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebend space and time and create a black hole!
Ledian: A black hole?!\xfffeYou mean a mass of gravity that swallows\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeup everything?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA dangerous invention like this is only to\xfffebe expected of you barbarian humans!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBug-type Pokémon would never think to\xfffecreate such a perilous device!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a terrible weapon, made to\xfffeannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt was your goal all along to eliminate\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeus all, wasn't it?!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ugh...\xfffeThis coolant liquid is extremely powerful...
Ledian: Cold... So cold...\xfffeI'm not good against ice...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: There's a good\xfffechance that it will spread until it engulfs\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe entire world, ushering in a new ice age!
Ledian: An ice age...\xfffeUs Bug-type Pokémon wouldn't survive...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA dangerous invention like this is only to\xfffebe expected of you barbarian humans!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBug-type Pokémon would never think to\xfffecreate such a perilous device!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a terrible weapon, made to\xfffeannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt was your goal all along to eliminate\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeus all, wasn't it?!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It'll be OK!\xfffeMy temporal transport is highly resistant\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto heat!
Ledian: Just like a Scientist to get all\xfffeexcited whenever you talk about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesomething scientific...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hmph...\xfffeI'm the brilliant scientist who invented\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis temporal transport!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA small complication such as this is well\xfffewithin expectations!
Ledian: It's as if you entered your own\xfffeworld... What incredible concentration...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnother common trait of you Scientists...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'll show you\xfffeI can change history!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: OK! It's charged\xfffeup enough energy now!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI should be able to go back to the past!
Ledian: So you tricked me into bringing out\xfffethe temporal transport so you could charge\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit with lightning...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Impressive, I must say. You may have\xfffeonly two arms, but you're pretty good...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ledian...\xfffeYou may have been right. I was selfish to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave come into the future like this...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was only in the interest of science that\xfffeI came to this era. I apologize if I've made\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea mess of things here...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere! I'll give you these items back.
Ledian: What is this?\xfffeSome dirt...rocks...plant seeds?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's a bunch of junk...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's this?!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's wrong?
Ledian: ...Do you know what this is?\xfffeYou just saved your life, human...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...No, you just saved the lives of all\xfffehumans--past, present, and future...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHow impressive...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...This is the stone that allowed us\xfffeBug-type Pokémon to revolt against\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou humans...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right...\xfffeThis is the Evolution Stone...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you go back to your era without it,\xfffeeverything will change...
...And so I was able to safely return\xfffeto my own era...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...If I hadn't returned my research\xfffesamples to Ledian before coming back,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethen I would have brought back the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeEvolution Stone, which would have caused\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Bug-type Pokémon of my era to evolve at\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea rapid pace, and they would have\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeventually revolted against us humans...
...I never would have thought that I would\xfffehave been responsible for changing the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefate of the human race...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...It still remains to be seen whether\xfffechanging the future like I did was indeed\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea good thing, though...
...However, before I changed the future,\xfffeLedian looked down on all other life-forms\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand lived all alone...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...I hope that in the future that I brought\xfffeabout, Ledian will at least feel a little\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeless lonely.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's all that I can really do\xffferight now...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm not sure\xfffeexactly why, but it looks like I might be\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeable to use the temporal transport now...
Ledian: Stop right there! I won't let you\xfffeget away! I will eliminate you!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ha ha ha!\xfffeFarewell, Ledian!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've got the research samples that I came\xfffefor, so there's no reason for me to stick\xf000븀\x0000\xfffearound here any longer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going back home to my own era to\xfffelive in peace!
Ledian: Mwa ha ha ha...\xfffeYou fell right into my trap!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?!
Ledian: I realized that you carry the\xfffeEvolution Stone in your bag, so I decided\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto let you go...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure I don't have to tell you what will\xfffehappen to the Pokémon of your era if you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebring the Evolution Stone back...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBon voyage, foolish Human...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll be waiting for you here, in the world\xfffeafter the Pokémon revolt...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It can't be so!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh no... It's no good...\xfffeI can't stop the temporal transport!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo! I don't want to go back like this!\xfffeIf I go back now, the revolt will occur!
Ledian: You were such a foolish, foolish\xfffehuman... Not to mention such a fun toy\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto play with...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor a pathetic human with only two arms, you\xfffesure provided me with much entertainment!
...And so I was able to return safely\xfffeto my own era...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...However, it was because of my safe\xfffereturn that the world changed forever...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...The effects of the Evolution Stone were\xfffequick. The Bug-type Pokémon soon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetransformed into terrible overlords who\xf000븀\x0000\xfffereigned over us.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSoon, we normal humans became a different\xfffekind of human--their playthings...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's this?\xfffeThese energy readings coming from the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetemporal transport shouldn't be possible!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey're exceeding the limit!
Ledian: What's going to happen?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hrmm?\xfffeOh... Oh no!
Ledian: What?!
...I surveyed my surroundings after\xffferegaining consciousness, but I couldn't\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebelieve what lay before me...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...For as far as the eye could see was\xfffenothing but machinery...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEntire cities made of machines, inhabited\xfffeby humans and their heartless robot\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemasters, who treated them like common parts\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof a great machine, discarding and replacing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethem as needed...
...I had come even further into the future,\xfffebut it was even worse than the era in which\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBug-type Pokémon reigned supreme...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn this future, robots ruled over all living\xfffebeings and used them as simple tools...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI couldn't believe it. I felt my head spin,\xfffeand I collapsed right then and there...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...As my consciousness began to fade away,\xfffeI could see one of the robots approaching.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hmmm...\xfffeI guess it just won't work...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow unfortunate. I heard this move could\xfffetranscend time.
Ledian: What are you doing?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's that?\xfffeOh, I just thought it would be nice if I\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecould bend time using a Pokémon move...
Ledian: Of all the idiotic things...\xfffeDid you really invent this time machine?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's different!
Ledian: Ugh... Why am I wasting my time\xfffewith this dumb human?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?!\xfffeCut me some slack...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt was worth a try!
Ledian: Whatever... At least you're dense\xfffeenough to provide some entertainment.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess it's better than being alone...

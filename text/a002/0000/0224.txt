Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?\xfffeWhere is this place?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt feels so strange here...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat could that white door\xfffeI opened have been, anyway?
Strange Lady: My, my...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt looks like a weak little child\xfffewandered through the door\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI set up as a trap.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEeee hee hee... Great timing.\xfffeI need a new servant.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hm? Who are you?\xfffeWhy are you in a place like this, woman?\xf000븁\x0000
Strange Lady: Grr...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCalling someone you just met “woman"?\xfffeWhat a rude little brat!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow can you look like that and\xfffenot know how to address people?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's with you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeKnow what, lady? I'd really like\xfffeto get out of here soon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm the prince of this kingdom, so show\xfffeme how to get back to the castle, already!
Strange Lady: I'm afraid that's impossible.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I'm not just some lady.\xfffeI'm the queen of the Land of Enchantment.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMy name is Bellelba!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: How about that...\xfffeQueen of the Land of Enchantment, huh?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhoooooa! A w-witch!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI h-have to hurry back\xfffethrough that door!
Bellelba: Weee hee hee... Fool.\xfffeYou can't run away.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHave a look behind you.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: No! No! No!\xfffeA Pokémon is blocking the door!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf one of my servants was here,\xfffethey'd give it a good wallop, too!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\xfffeCan't you do anything on your own?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat a pitiful prince!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's right...\xfffeI'm alone right now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess if I don't want to be caught,\xfffethe only thing to do is fight for myself...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Whoa! Oh no!\xfffeThose Woobat are getting closer and closer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have to hurry and...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Defeat them!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\xfffeTry if you dare!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Catch them!
Bellelba: Hey!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCatching someone else's Pokémon\xfffeis stealing! That's common sense, right?!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Use my Pokédex!
Bellelba: You've got to be kidding...\xfffeWoobat is a Bat Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd just so you know, Swoobat\xfffeis a Courting Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSigh... Are you that confident?\xfffeOr that stupid?
Bellelba: You're wasting your time.\xfffeOnce you pass through that door,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can't go back to your own world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour destiny is to be caught by me\xfffeand to become my loyal servant.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Well...\xfffeThey're even closer than before!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't want to be a servant!\xfffeI can't serve someone else!
Bellelba: Acting tough, are we?\xfffeYou're worth pushing around, aren't you?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHah...
Bellelba: OK!\xfffeWe've almost got you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you ready?\xfffeYou'll be in my clutches soon!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I won't quit!
Bellelba: Oh...\xfffeFeeling brave, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat just makes me want\xfffeto make you suffer more!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh ha ha ha ha...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm done for!
Bellelba: Oh, how pessimistic.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, the youth of today give up\xfffeso very easily...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWell, time to join me, then!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: But I'm rich!
Bellelba: What? Money?\xfffeThat's a weird thing for a brat to say!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA-and it's not like I want\xfffeyour money anyway!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh...\xfffeIf I'd only listened to Father,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI wouldn't be in this mess.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo one's going to come save me...\xfffeGuess I have to do something on my own...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\xfffeWhat are you mumbling about?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're almost ours now!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh...\xfffeI wonder if I can win...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't even care anymore...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee... Wonderful...\xfffeI'll tell you something interesting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBreathing the air in this world\xfffesaps your will.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder how long you and your Pokémon\xfffewill have the desire to keep fighting.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Sheesh...\xfffeThis...is really stupid...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut...if I don't beat you...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll be made a servant...
Bellelba: Not bad at all.\xfffeB-by the way, what was that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemoney you were talking about earlier?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ha ha haaa!\xfffeThis is my allowance for ONE week!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you want it?\xfffeIf you want to be rich,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetake me to my castle now!
Bellelba: Wh-whaaat?!\xfffeIn one week, you get THIS much\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemoney for an allowance?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWow! Is my fortune so small?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hee hee...\xfffePoor peasant...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm heir to the throne!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOf course there's a difference!
Bellelba: Gr...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to take your money,\xfffeyour crown, and everything else!
Bellelba: You're kidding!\xfffeYou're so weak!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I lost...\xfffeI lost...
Bellelba: Wow...\xfffeWouldn't it be better if you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetrained in battle a little bit?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Yes...\xfffeYou're exactly right...
Bellelba: Good grief...\xfffeInstead of simply living a life of luxury in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe castle, how about going on a journey?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeActually, I know a beautiful, black-haired\xfffeyoung woman who is really strong.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeShall I introduce her to you?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What? Really?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBlack haired? Beautiful?\xfffeAnd she's young?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou don't mind?\xfffeI'd really, really like that!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYaaay! Yaaay!\xfffeA beautiful, black-haired young woman!
Bellelba: Wow...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't want a brat like you\xfffein my Land of Enchantment...
So Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffeset off to train.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr better said, he set off\xfffeon a journey to meet the young woman.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt any rate, he got out\xfffeof the door safely,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand that's probably for the best...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh, I'm so tired...
Bellelba: Well now...\xfffeI'm all caught up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you ready?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Help!\xfffeFather, save me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I'd known this was going to happen,\xfffeI'd have listened and behaved better!
Bellelba: Eee hee heee...\xfffeI knew you were a prince\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom the very beginning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd that you are a vapid, foolish prince\xfffewho doesn't listen to his parents\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand does nothing more than goof off.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI already anticipated\xfffethat you'd come here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd now, that foolish prince\xfffeis going to go missing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen that happens, it will cause\xfffechaos in the country, and a war will begin.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's that about?\xfffeSomething like that would never happen\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a kingdom like mine!
Bellelba: I wonder about that...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you think people can trust a king\xfffewho can't protect his heir,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeven if it is an idiot like you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI also suspect that your father\xfffewill get worn out as he tears apart\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeverything looking for you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome nobleman might take advantage\xfffeof this and take his throne.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You...\xfffeYou were hired by the nobleman!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFather! Father!\xfffeI'm over here!
Bellelba: That's not going to work.\xfffeI don't think you have time to worry.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFrom today on, you're my new servant.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's go! Get walking!
The captured Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffeis said to have worked in Bellelba's mansion\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeuntil he died...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs Bellelba said, the evil nobleman\xfffestole the throne from the king\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand the country was destroyed...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I did it!\xfffeI defeated the Swoobat!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI can escape now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHuh?!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Where is it?\xfffeCome on! Where's the exit?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhere is that door?!
Bellelba: Oh my, didn't I say\xfffethat escape was impossible?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe door back to your old world\xfffeisn't here anymore!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's that about!\xfffeWhat in the world is going on?
Bellelba: Good grief you're loud.\xfffeIt would be a lot of trouble if you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewent on a rampage and found the real door.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor now, I guess I'll just\xfffeshut you in this Magic Cage...
Magic Cage: Clank!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Whaaa!\xfffeLet go of me! Let me out of here!
The strange lady who calls herself\xfffethe magic queen, Bellelba,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeput Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a Magic Cage after he'd\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewandered into this world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffesafely return to his own world?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll we can do is hope\xfffefor his safe return...

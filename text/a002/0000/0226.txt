Gatekeeper
Plush Toy: I don't think that'll work.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou should just calm down\xfffeand stay here with me...
Plush Toy: Aaaah!\xfffeYou're making such a racket\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat the magic world is creaking!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBellelba's going to be mad...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: The door won't open!\xfffeSomebody let me out of here!
Plush Toy: The gate is enchanted.\xfffeIt can't be opened...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Whoa!\xfffeThe Plush Toy talked!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAmaaazing! That's cool!
Plush Toy: Uhhh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you understand the situation you're in?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, I don't think I've ever seen anyone\xfffeso happy when they saw me before.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, I'm in a good mood today,\xfffeso I'll give you a little hint.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat door gets weak when it's cold.\xfffeHowever...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: However?
Plush Toy: Ummm...\xfffeI can't say anything more.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFigure out the rest on your own.
Plush Toy: You're trying hard!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Plush Toy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't have anything better to\xfffedo than sit there, give me a hand!
Plush Toy: In case you forgot,\xfffeI AM the gatekeeper here.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMy job is to watch you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBellelba would get mad at me if I helped.\xfffeAnd besides...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA long time ago, I tried to open the door,\xfffebut it didn't work.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI failed...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Why?
Plush Toy: I had the same problem as you.\xfffeI didn't know how to break the door.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You, too?
Plush Toy: What?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you feel sorry\xfffefor me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: *Snicker*
Plush Toy: Harrumph...\xfffeYou know what? You're kind of a creep.
Black Door: Claaaang!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: All right!\xfffeI broke the door, didn't I?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNow I can leave, right?
Plush Toy: No. I'm afraid not...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Why not?\xfffeI broke the door like I was supposed to!
Plush Toy: Don't you get it?\xfffeYou can't just break the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedoor like you did.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can't just break something\xfffemade with magic by force.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure Bellelba heard that\xfffenoise and will be on her way.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't think she'll forgive you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHeh heh heh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLooks like I get people soup tonight.\xfffeIt's been a long time.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're a prince, right?\xfffeI'm sure you've been eating well.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou should make great broth!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: No...\xfffeNoooooo!
Were Plush Toy's words true?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo one knows...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere is no record of what happened\xfffeto the prince after that...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Sigh...
Plush Toy: Hey...\xfffeHow long are you going to keep that up?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I can't help it!\xfffeThis thing's tough!
Plush Toy: Yeah, it should be!\xfffeIt's Bellelba's magic.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, you're pretty tough\xfffefor a prince.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure you'll be working\xfffefor her from tomorrow on,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut you should be able to take it!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Quiet, you!\xfffeI don't need compliments like that!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat do you mean working?\xfffeWhat is she going to make me do?
Plush Toy: What will you do?\xfffeThere's a pile of things to do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCooking, laundry, cleaning...\xfffeEven that is really hard work.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou also have to take care of\xfffethings like that door you were fighting.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey are her pets!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Uwagh!\xfffeThat sounds like such a pain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the kind of work\xfffefor a servant!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNot for a prince!
Plush Toy: Come on now...\xfffeLife isn't that easy.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou are so spoiled.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe a person like you\xfffeshould have been caught...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Whaaa!\xfffeFather! Mother!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMinister! Servants!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSomebody! Save meee!
And so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001,\xfffeshaking with fear about his\xf000븀\x0000\xfffework in the morning, finally\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefell asleep.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe kept telling himself that\xfffeat least he was still alive...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I've been beaten...
Plush Toy: Awww...\xfffeWhat a shame...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBaaad stuff's going to happen to you...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Huh?!
Plush Toy: Those who lose\xfffeto the magic door...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey are turned into doors by the\xfffemagic that was cast on that door!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey!\xfffeWhat?
Plush Toy: It's just as I said--you're\xfffegoing to change into a door.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSince you're a prince, I'm sure it's\xfffegoing to be an ornate door with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelots of gorgeous decorations...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI bet you'll fetch a good price...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: This is terrible!\xfffeI don't want to become a door!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEach and every single day!\xfffeShutting and closing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeShutting and closing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's all I'd ever do!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI can't stand it!
Plush Toy: ...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you never plan\xfffeon opening, then?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, enjoy being able to\xfffemake dumb jokes while you can...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: ...
And so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001,\xfffewho lost to the black door,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebecame a door himself.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSurely, he's working as the door\xfffeto some house now...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey, Plush Toy.\xfffeIsn't it OK now?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWould you just give me a hint already?
Plush Toy: Like I said, I'm the gatekeeper!\xfffeI can't!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd what's more--there is no hint!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if you somehow manage to get out,\xfffeyou're going to end up a servant.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's no way you can get away\xfffefrom Bellelba in her own world!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Who cares!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hate just sitting here quietly\xfffelocked up in this cage!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA dark, damp place like this isn't\xfffesuitable for a royal prince\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike myself, now is it?
Plush Toy: Sure... Whatever...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour pride is a little repulsive,\xfffebut I feel like you've got some guts.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm gonna do it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to break down that door!\xfffeI'll put my pride as a prince at stake!
Plush Toy: You're sure fired up...\xfffeIf you're that excited, you might\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebe able to make something work. Maybe...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: But you know what...\xfffeThis is just too much work for me...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't care about the stupid door anymore.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey, Plush Toy.\xfffeI'll give you my allowance.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWould you please let me out?
Plush Toy: Really?! That's your plan?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBribing me? I tell you...\xfffeIf you're the prince of a country,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehumanity's future is looking pretty dark.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst of all, I'm a Plush Toy.\xfffeWhat am I supposed to do with money?!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You shabby reject!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor a stupid Plush Toy,\xfffeyou've sure got a mouth!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhatever! I don't need you!\xfffeI'll break it myself!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey...\xfffeWhy were you caught?
Plush Toy: Um...\xfffeI don't really remember...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure it was a reason\xfffesimilar to yours though.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hmmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou've sure had it hard\xfffefor a Plush Toy.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's why you're worn out and filthy...
Plush Toy: That's too much!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I wasn't born a Plush Toy, you know?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI used to be a person,\xfffejust like you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBellelba's spell changed me into this,\xfffeand I have to be the gatekeeper forever...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's terrible!\xfffeWhy don't you run away?
Plush Toy: I know...\xfffeI would like to, but...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUnlike you, I don't have a Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, my body is made of cotton,\xfffeso I don't move very well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't really know how I\xfffecould get away from Bellelba!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I don't care...
Plush Toy: Y-you're really cold...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's the deal? You were the one\xfffewho asked about me in the first place...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Flee with me!
Plush Toy: Are you serious?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: How hopeless...
Plush Toy: Well, it's OK.\xfffeYour sympathy won't help me.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's not like it's your problem.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\xfffeIt looks like it will break\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeafter just a little more!
Plush Toy: ...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's wrong?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you worried because\xfffeI might get away?
Plush Toy: ...So...about the door...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What about it?
Plush Toy: You can't just break\xfffethat door with force...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen it looks like the door\xfffeis just about to break,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou need to surprise it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you do that,\xfffeit will run away without being broken...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the only way\xfffeto get it out of the way.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: ...\xfffeWhy did you tell me this?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're the gatekeeper, right?\xfffeWasn't that the last hint\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea few minutes ago?
Plush Toy: I am the gatekeeper...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut...\xfffeYou invited me to run away with you, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd even though you're grumbling,\xfffeyou don't give up and keep working!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Thank you!\xfffeWe'll get out together, for sure!
Plush Toy: Hmmm...\xfffeYou're better than I suspected.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Huff... Puff...\xfffeI did it... The door's gone...
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\xfffeBut you still can't leave...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What's that mean?\xfffeIf I break the door, I can get out!
Plush Toy: Heh heh heh...\xfffeYou DID break the door,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut the gatekeeper's still here!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I see.\xfffeOK, Plush Toy! Out of the way!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIf you get in my way, I'll turn you into\xf000븀\x0000\xfffescraps of cloth and fluff balls!
Plush Toy: Oh. Big talk...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know what's gonna happen to you\xfffeif you think I'm just a ball of fluff!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Bring it on!\xfffeI don't even need a Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeagainst a Plush Toy like you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll pulverize you with the prince-fu\xfffeI developed!
Plush Toy: Bring it on...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Try on my\xfffeprince jump-kick for size!
Plush Toy: Ha...\xfffeToo slow...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 broke the door of the\xfffemagic cage, but a Plush Toy stood in front\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof the celebrating prince, blocking the way.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 attacked, but the\xfffeblow was not enough to stop the Plush Toy.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Plush Toy found an opening and brought\xfffedown Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 in an instant...
Plush Toy: Whoa! What a surprise!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Huh?!\xfffeWhat's that all of the sudden?
Plush Toy: That Plush Toy...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: ...Oh, this?\xfffeThe toy used for Substitute?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow that you mention it,\xfffeit does look just like you...
Plush Toy: It sure does...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, well, I didn't always look like this.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Really?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh! Could it be?!\xfffeMy older brother went missing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCould you be him?!
Plush Toy: Ha ha... I doubt it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, since I've been in this world,\xfffeI've kept forgetting about the past,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso who knows?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat was his name anyway?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Um...\xfffeI think it was Kevin, or something like that?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy father and mother don't want to\xfffetalk about it, so...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe only reason I heard about the\xfffename was the minister told me in secret.
Plush Toy: Kevin...\xfffeHm... I see...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Well, regardless...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope you return to your old self someday!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...I see... \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001...\xfffeYou sure got big fast...)
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou surprised the black door,\xfffeand it ran away!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I did it!\xfffeThe door's gone!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverything went as planned, right?
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\xfffeOK, get going then!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What are you saying?\xfffeYou're coming with me!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWe're running away together!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I get away while you stay here, as\xfffethe gatekeeper, you'll be punished, right?
Plush Toy: But...\xfffeEven if we get away,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't have anywhere to go...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if I leave the cage,\xfffeit's the magic world...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBellelba will catch me\xfffeand wipe me out!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I know that!\xfffeWe can't leave like this!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWe have to do something about Bellelba!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I will definitely need\xfffeyour advice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you absolutely must\xfffecome with me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we make it back to our own world,\xfffeyou can live in my castle!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\xfffeOh, “absolutely must," huh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're really selfish...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, I agree...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll go with you!\xfffeI'll help you win!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll make myself small,\xfffeso put me in your pocket!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ah ha ha!\xfffeHey! That tickles!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 escaped\xfffefrom the magic cage along with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Plush Toy gatekeeper.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe's learned to be a little kinder\xfffeand become much stronger.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHe should be able to overcome\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehis final obstacle.

Nimbasa City is the city of entertainment!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWorking at the Pokémon Center\xfffethere was sure a lot of fun.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBig Stadium and Small Court are\xfffepacked with tough Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are so many other things\xfffeto see and do!

Mistralton City always makes me\xfffethink of Skyla!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople who had been hurt by\xfffethe device in her Pokémon Gym\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewould come to the Pokémon Center.\xf000븁\x0000

Opelucid City!\xfffeThat's a great city!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard that the mayor, Drayden,\xfffecan teach an amazing Dragon-type move!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 1...\xfffeUm, now, what was there?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, that's right! Using Surf will\xfffetake you to an unexpected place!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 2, eh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI vaguely remember there being\xfffesome ledges on that route!\xf000븁\x0000
The Day Care is on Route 3.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's a preschool there too, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd what was that other place called?\xfffeWellspring Cave, was it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's on that same route.\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Route 4!\xfffeAlways a lot going on over there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThings like construction and\xfffepeople finding ruins.\xf000븁\x0000
I used to slip out of the\xfffePokémon Center from time to time\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand go watch the performers on Route 5.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhile I was there, I met many people,\xfffesuch as a girl who would buy items.\xf000븁\x0000
Did you visit the Season Research Lab\xfffeon Route 6?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAlso, wasn't there a cave around there?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd... Oh, yes. Watch out!\xfffeYou might get fooled by something!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 7 has those raised walkways.\xfffeIf you stop, you fall right off!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, I seem to remember an unexpected\xfffePokémon popping out of the tall grass.\xf000븁\x0000
Route 8's puddles freeze in winter.\xfffeI liked how you could slide on them, but it\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewas a bit hard to make forward progress!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 9, huh.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe toughs that hang out there might\xfffechallenge you to a Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut you're a tough Trainer yourself,\xfffeso that works out great for you!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah, I liked Route 10.\xfffeThere was something lyrical about it...
Route 11 is just like Route 14.\xfffeWaterfall time!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 12's gently sloping hills\xffferoll up and down, up and down.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStrolling across them is a nice feeling!\xf000븁\x0000
My impression of Route 13\xfffeis that it's rather long!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI remember the main route's\xfffebeing hard to find, but it's nice\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebecause you can go many places!\xf000븁\x0000
You're on Route 14?\xfffeThen...use Waterfall, right?!\xf000븁\x0000

Route 16, huh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou sure don't expect to find\xfffea forest like that so close to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNimbasa City, do you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what the Lostlorn\xfffeForest is like these days.\xf000븁\x0000
Route 17, is it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe current was so fast,\xfffeI couldn't go where I wanted...\xf000븁\x0000

The Dreamyard...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've heard that rarely seen\xfffePokémon go there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA mysterious power remains\xfffethat draws them there.\xf000븁\x0000
Bug-type Pokémon can\xfffebe found all over Pinwheel Forest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, it never bugs me to\xfffesee Bug-type Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Watch out for sandstorms\xfffein the Desert Resort!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome types of Pokémon\xfffewill take constant damage in them!\xf000븁\x0000
The Relic Castle, you say?\xfffeYou'll get buried in sand!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou already know this, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you run onto pits in the sand,\xfffeyou'll fall through them!\xf000븁\x0000

Lacunosa Town... Oh, my word.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat made an impression on me when\xfffeI visited that town was that it was\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecompletely different from day to night.\xf000븁\x0000
Undella Town, Undella Town.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA very rich family used to live there,\xfffebut it looks like everyone moved.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hear the Marine Tube\xfffeis totally amazing!\xf000븁\x0000
Anville Town!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat?\xfffeWere you a big fan of trains?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStill, I understand how you feel.\xf000븁\x0000
The Pokémon League!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, my goodness!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, you just have to challenge\xfffethe Elite Four, and then...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBelieve in your Pokémon\xfffeand move forward!\xf000븁\x0000
Pardon me? Where?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeN's Castle?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sorry...\xfffeI've never heard of it.\xf000븁\x0000

Gear Station, then?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe trains to Anville Town get overlooked\xfffemore often than you'd expect!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have time, you should take a ride!\xf000븁\x0000
Battle Subway!\xfffeYou sure like challenges.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeKeeping a winning streak\xfffegoing is really hard.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the knowledge and experience you\xfffegain from battle will make you stronger!\xf000븁\x0000
Musical Theater!\xfffeHee hee hee!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI used to go there often, too!\xfffeI only went to watch, though!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon look so cute\xfffewith their accessories and dancing!\xf000븁\x0000
Black City, huh?\xfffeI wonder how it has changed.\xf000븁\x0000

Wellspring Cave...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's small, but exploring deep within\xfffethe cave is surprisingly difficult.\xf000븁\x0000
Mistralton Cave, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMany Trainers go there\xfffeto catch a Pokémon called Axew!\xf000븁\x0000
Rumination Field?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, yes!\xfffeDeep in Pinwheel Forest, as I remember.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow, what are you doing in a\xfffeplace like that?\xf000븁\x0000

Moor of Icirrus...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMoor of Icirrus...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat is it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've heard of it,\xfffebut I've never been there...\xf000븁\x0000
A Shopping Mall?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHm. Now, I wonder why the first thing\xfffethat came to mind was the storeroom!\xf000븁\x0000

P2 Laboratory?\xfffeI don't know much about that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould that be the lab on Route 17?\xf000븁\x0000
The Skyarrow Bridge is sure amazing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen I saw that the first time...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right, saw it, not crossed it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess, at the time,\xfffeI was just astonished.\xf000븁\x0000
The Driftveil Drawbridge, eh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've always wanted to see the\xfffebridge opening and closing.\xf000븁\x0000
Did you feel the vibrations of the Tubeline\xfffeBridge on the bottom of your feet?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt feels like those vibrations give you\xfffeenergy. I just love that feeling!\xf000븁\x0000
Recently, the Village Bridge\xfffehas changed a bit, and there are\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethings like tennis courts there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's no Pokémon Center, though.\xfffeI haven't really gotten used to it yet.\xf000븁\x0000

The Trial Chamber?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Trainer might have told\xfffeme about it a long time ago.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWas it the little room on\xfffeVictory Road?\xf000븁\x0000
The Guidance Chamber...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, I remember!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWasn't it in the deepest\xfffepart of Mistralton Cave?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome people think it's a place\xfffewhere hard-to-find Pokémon live.\xf000븁\x0000

Accumula Gate is, um, well...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUmmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes anything make it different\xfffefrom any other gate?\xf000븁\x0000

Route Gate?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHee hee. There are two gates\xfffecalled Route Gates.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe first one is off Route 1, and the\xfffeother is close to the Desert Resort!\xf000븁\x0000
The Abyssal Ruins!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA mysterious, ancient script!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd if you solve its secret,\xfffeplease tell me what it is!\xf000븁\x0000
What?\xfffeYou're in Aspertia?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen you should come home!\xfffeTo your own house!\xf000븁\x0000
Virbank City!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou went to a music club?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRecently, I've been getting into\xfffeRoxie's band!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen I listen to them,\xfffeI feel so full of energy!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh my! You're in Humilau City?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the nicest of all the resort areas\xfffein the Unova region!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was only at the Pokémon Center\xfffein that town for a short while.\xf000븁\x0000
Pokéstar Studios!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat?! You're going to\xfffebe in a movie?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWell, I'll have to go see it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, a little advice--acting\xfffeis all about being natural!\xf000븁\x0000

You're in Floccesy Town for a spell?\xfffeDid you visit Alder's house?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA long time ago, Alder taught me about\xfffePokémon! Boy, that takes me back!\xf000븁\x0000
Lentimas Town is close to\xfffeReversal Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's small, but it has an air of uniqueness\xfffethat makes it surprisingly popular!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 19 is right outside of Aspertia.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess you could say it's a valley road.\xf000븁\x0000
Route 20 is a place where you can\xfffeenjoy the changing of the seasons.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy favorite season is fall!\xfffeYou know, the foliage, the colors... Ah...\xf000븁\x0000
I guess you could say that Route 21\xfffeis very rocky. It's like a maze.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou might find it surprisingly hard to\xfffemake progress!\xf000븁\x0000
Route 22 is very lush and green.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo that could well indicate that you'll\xfffefind many different Pokémon there.\xf000븁\x0000
Route 23, huh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's the last great natural\xfffearea in the Unova region.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApparently, the path is so steep\xfffeand dangerous that some people\xf000븀\x0000\xfffego on and on about it.\xf000븁\x0000
Castelia Sewers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's just another way to say it's\xfffeCastelia City's sewer system.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sorry I can't help more.\xfffeI know about it, but I've never been.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, listen!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've heard there's a secret place\xfffelocated at the far end of the sewer!\xf000븁\x0000
The ranch!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApparently, when I was little,\xfffeI rode a Pokémon and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeveryone got really mad!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I was just a little kid,\xfffeand I don't remember that at all!\xf000븁\x0000

Relic Passage...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs the name suggests, it's\xfffean underground passage built long ago.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you pass through it, maybe you'll\xfffefind out who made it and why!\xf000븁\x0000
Clay Tunnel, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard Clay kept on digging\xfffeno matter what.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what it is about digging that\xfffeis so captivating to some folks.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI heard there is someone who loves\xfffedigging in the Sinnoh region as well.\xf000븁\x0000

The Seaside Cave, so, so, so...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt some point, waves, wind, and Pokémon\xfffemade that cave in that giant rock.\xf000븁\x0000
The Cave of Being. Ah, yes, I recall it.\xfffeI wonder what's in there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApparently, it's a strange\xfffeplace with nothing inside.\xf000븁\x0000
A Hidden Grotto...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have no idea what that is!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHonestly, I'm not hiding anything!\xf000븁\x0000

Virbank Gate, and...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGates are pretty much the same\xfffeeverywhere, wouldn't you say?\xf000븁\x0000

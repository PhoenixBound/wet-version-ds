Future Being
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Could this be...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...Is this the future?...)
Ledian: Hmm... What's this?\xfffeYou're a strange-looking Human.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou look kind of like a Scientist, but\xfffeI've never seen your type before.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It's a person...\xfffeI'd better try not to do too much damage...
Ledian: That dumb Human is holding back.\xfffeIt doesn't want to hurt another of its\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeown kind.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmph. Such a common trait among\xfffethe weaker species. How foolish.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Are you telling\xfffeme you don't care?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou wouldn't mind hurting another Pokémon?
Ledian: How could you obey a Human\xfffelike that? Such disgraceful Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll eliminate you all!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I don't need\xfffeto defeat the people you're controlling\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto protect my Pokémon!
Ledian: That's enough talk from you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs that the Scientist Ability?\xfffeRunning your mouth?
Ledian: Stop right there, Human!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: A Pokémon?!
Ledian: It's not often that we get\xfffewild Humans showing up in town...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey're dangerous and need to be\xfffeeliminated quickly!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: A talking Pokémon?\xfffeDid it just release a person from that Ball?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat's going on here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's like everything is backward!
Ledian: Huh?\xfffeHumans using Pokémon?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat is this madness?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Wait!\xfffeTell me what's going on here!
Ledian: What's going on?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere's how things work here: you lowly\xfffeHumans go into these Human Balls, and then\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou do as your Trainer Pokémon commands!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWild Humans who won't go into the Balls\xfffeare to be eliminated! It's simple!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?\xfffeIn the world of the future, Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecatch people?!
Ledian: The future? Are you trying to tell\xfffeme that you come from the past?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Well...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...Should I tell this Pokémon about\xfffehow I traveled through time?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt probably won't believe me...)
Ledian: Or are you just a dirty lying Human?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLying is cowardice! Cowardice is a crime!\xfffeYou must be eliminated!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Help!
Ledian: Begging for your life, are you?\xfffeWhat a pathetic Human! I think I'll take\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy time eliminating you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCome out, Black Belt! Teach this\xfffecowardly Human a lesson!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Can we talk?
Ledian: Talk? Why should a Pokémon\xfffetalk to a pathetic Human like you?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHow ridiculous!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm not lying!
Ledian: How could that be true?\xfffeYou must be lying. Lying is a crime.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCriminals must be eliminated.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBlack Belt, take care of this liar!
Ledian: What's wrong, Human?\xfffeYou can't even fight back?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I don't want\xfffeto fight! Stop this!
Ledian: If you don't want to fight,\xfffeyou'd better release that \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I can't do that...
Ledian: I didn't think so!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHumans are so weak. You've only got\xfffetwo arms, and you can't even fly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon must make great bodyguards\xfffefor you Humans. Or do you treat them\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemore like tools for your own convenience?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's not true!\xfffePokémon are my friends!
Ledian: A likely story.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnyway, Humans like you are simply tools\xfffefor us Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're just toys who battle each other for\xfffeour enjoyment! It doesn't matter if you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebreak--there are plenty of replacements!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's terrible...
Black Belt: You...\xfffeHuman who use Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou understand me?
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You can speak?
Black Belt: Stuck in Ball...\xfffeTreated like thing...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNot talk ever. Not talk good.\xfffeBut must talk you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou say you from past.\xfffeI believe.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Thank you...\xfffeI appreciate it!
Black Belt: Long ago. Bug Pokémon get\xfffestrong. Evolution Stone make strong.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey take over.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeE-lim-i-nate many human...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?!\xfffeWhat's an Evolution Stone?
Black Belt: Evolution Stone...\xfffeMake Bug Pokémon very smart...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon strong and smart...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNo chance for human...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I never\xfffeimagined the future could be like this...
Ledian: Black Belt! Silence!\xfffeStop yapping with that other Human!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're nothing more than a tool!\xfffeDo as I say or face the consequences!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm only telling\xfffethe truth! Please, believe me!
Ledian: Even with the superior technology\xfffeof the Bug-type Pokémon, we haven't been\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeable to achieve time travel. There's no way\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea mere Human could have done so!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: But I did! I came\xfffehere on a time machine of my own invention!
Ledian: You're just lying to save yourself.\xfffeIt's rare to see a Human as clever as you.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat makes you dangerous.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'd better eliminate you for good measure!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's not fair!
Ledian: Come on, Black Belt!\xfffeHurry up and eliminate this scum.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm done wasting my time talking to\xfffethis dirty Human!
Ledian: How did you do that?!\xfffeYou protected your Pokémon without\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehurting my Black Belt!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeInteresting. You are an unusual Human.\xfffeOK, I'll spare you from elimination.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll also believe your wild story.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut first...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSit still and let me catch you!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: No!\xfffeWhat's this? Some kind of string?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGet it off me! Untie this string now!\xfffeLet me go!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ack!\xfffeThe more I try to break free, the more\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestuck I get...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe powerful sticky string of a\xfffeBug-type Pokémon...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Please!\xfffeI don't mean to harm any of you!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou've had your fun!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just want to get back to my own time!
Ledian: You think so?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUnfortunately for you, I'll be the\xfffejudge of when I've had my fun...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What more\xfffedo you want from me?
Ledian: Hee hee hee...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...We couldn't make a time machine with\xfffeour own technology, but if I could get my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeappendages on this Human's time machine,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'd be a hero...)
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Come on!\xfffeSay something!
Ledian: OK, then...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...If I can capture Humans from all the\xfffedifferent eras, we Bug-type Pokémon will\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeprosper even more...)
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Stop!\xfffeGet away from my Bag!
Ledian: What's all this junk?\xfffeDirt and rocks... Plant seeds...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's just a bunch of garbage!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmm... What's this?\xfffeLooks like a Human Ball.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomething's different, though...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've got it! Could this be...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh no...\xfffeNot the temporal transport...
Ledian: Bingo! So, this is your time machine.\xfffeTemporal transport, you called it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeImpressive to have fit it into a capsule\xfffethis small...
And so Ledian captured me and seized\xfffemy temporal transport.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I would not give up so easily.\xfffeNot while I still needed to deliver these\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeprecious research samples back to my own\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetime... I had to keep fighting.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Argh... Urgh...
Ledian: Stupid, pathetic, helpless Human...\xfffeI'm starting to feel sorry for you, so I'll\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelet you go...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEntertain me by scampering away like the\xfffecowardly fool you are.
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Eeek!
Ledian: Constantly eliminating Humans\xfffelike you gets old after a while...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I need to mix things up for a change of\xfffepace, or else I'd get bored with my toys!
Somehow, I made it away with my life.\xfffeAfterward, I had to lie low by hiding inside\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecaves and patches of tall grass in order to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeavoid the gaze of Pokémon who aimed to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedefeat or capture humans like me...
Sometimes I stop to think about the\xfffePokémon of my own time...how they must\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefeel if they don't want to be caught...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm in a constant state of fear and\xfffeunease, with never a moment's rest.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis life is only pain and struggle...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ack! I went too far!
Ledian: What's this?\xfffeYou've broken my Black Belt!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh well, no great loss... I'll just have\xfffeto go catch another Human...
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh... Oh no...\xfffeIt was an accident!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHow could I have done such a thing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto a fellow human...
Ledian: You toys break too easily.\xfffeHey, I know! I'll just catch you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto replace that one! Human Ball, go!
I passed out from the shock of defeating\xfffea fellow human. Ledian caught me, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI became one of her Humans.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd then...
Ledian: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001, I choose you!\xfffeHurry up and eliminate that Human!
Professor \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Groaarr!
Ledian: Good job, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHee hee hee... You've grown quite\xfffestrong, indeed!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll treat you to a special grooming today!
Ledian could be very cruel, but she also\xfffecould be nice to Humans who pleased her.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOver time, I gradually became more and\xfffemore loyal to Ledian...to the point that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI would do anything to assist her...
A world where Humans are used and\xfffecontrolled by Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf this is the reality of the future,\xfffeI have no choice but to accept it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes I wonder what became of\xfffe\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000, who was my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein our own time...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you out there having grand adventures\xfffeas a Trainer Pokémon?

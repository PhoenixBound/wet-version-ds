The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Eeeek!\xfffeI lost to such a starry-eyed girl...
Pollyanna: See? Justice prevails!\xfffeMy brother was right!
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja failed in his attempt\xfffeto capture Pollyanna. On the contrary,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePollyanna captured him and turned\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehim over to the World Police.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs long as there is justice in this world,\xfffeevil will never prosper!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCongratulations on making a great citizen's\xfffearrest, Pollyanna! Rise and fight, citizen!
Pollyanna: Aaaah! It can't be...\xfffeIt's not fair that I didn't win\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen I'm doing the right thing!
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: That's right.\xfffeHonesty doesn't pay.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's the kind of dirty world it is.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNo one can keep their hands clean.
Pollyanna: Uh-oh, m-my... He is cool.\xfffeI shouldn't feel this way...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut I can't help it...
Pollyanna lost to the \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja\xfffeand, to her own surprise, felt a surge of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeadmiration for evil!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're in trouble, Mecha Cop!\xfffeYour little sister is at a very difficult age!
Pollyanna: No, oh no...\xfffeWith my feelings mixed up like this,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy big brother will hate me...
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Hate you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're brother and sister, right?\xfffeWhy would he hate you for having feelings?
Pollyanna: My brother's justice\xfffeis my justice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I can't win against you, then\xfffeto my brother, that means I'm evil, too!
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Tsk...\xfffeI'm sorry for you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAs I always thought,\xfffethere is no good in justice, either...
Pollyanna: I'm s-sorry...\xfffeSorry...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSorry...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffe...
In pursuit of an ideal of justice,\xfffePollyanna got caught up in fear--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefear of making mistakes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMecha Cop might have missed\xfffea key factor in training his\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelittle sister. Forgotten? Feelings...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTake care of your family, Mecha Cop!\xfffeTrain hard, but leave room for feelings!
Pollyanna: This can't be happening...\xfffeAfter all my special training with my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebrother, I lost... It can't be true...
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Heh heh heh!\xfffeWith you as bait, I'll lure Mecha Cop\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto his utter defeat!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd, at that moment, what you two\xfffecall...justice...will crumble!
Pollyanna: Stop! Let me go!\xfffeMy brother! Help me!
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja,\xfffeafter successfully capturing Pollyanna,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecornered Mecha Cop and overpowered him.
But, several years later...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePollyanna, driven by vengeance\xfffeagainst the \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebecame a secret detective\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof the World Police.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeReborn as a reinforced cyborg female cop,\xfffeshe became Mecha Cop Woman.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven the score, Mecha Cop Woman!\xfffeMake him pay the price for the sake of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffejustice and the World Police!
Pollyanna: What?\xfffe(...This can't be right. False Swipe?...)\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...Is he holding back so that his Pokémon\xfffewon't beat Sewaddle?...)\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...)\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...Could he truly be a kindhearted man?...)
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Now, come\xfffealong quietly.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThere's no point in getting yourself hurt...
Pollyanna: (...Come to think of it...)\xfffe(...Back then, my brother was so kind...)\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...He was brutally injured while protecting\xfffeme...saved me from being hit by a truck...)\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe(...Despite it all, to keep working as a cop,\xfffehe allowed himself to be surgically\xf000븀\x0000\xfffereinforced with cyborg components...)
Pollyanna: Oh... How strange...\xfffeSuddenly, he looks like\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea sweet guy...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd... And... The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja\xfffeis kind of good looking, too...
The \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 Ninja: Don't worry. Follow\xfffemy instructions, and you won't get hurt.
Pollyanna: Captured...my heart...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, oh, I can't feel this way!\xfffeI'm Mecha Cop's little sister!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI have to be strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePol in Pollyanna is the same as\xfffePol in Police!

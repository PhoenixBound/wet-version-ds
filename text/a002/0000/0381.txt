I'm still a rookie, but someday\xfffeI will be a great player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll improve by having a lot\xfffeof Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Ugh!\xfffeI missed the rebound!
Hey, you might be a fan of mine.\xfffeI'll give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
I won't make excuses for losing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy waste time dreaming up excuses?\xfffeI'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the\xfffeyoung to get lots of exercise, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
A healthy sweat...\xfffeBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
Athletes like me are generous!\xfffeHere, have this!\xf000븁\x0000
I want a Poké Ball that's\xfffeas big as a basketball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think it would be more comfortable\xfffefor the Pokémon inside it.
POWER!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePower is essential for both\xfffePokémon and football!\xf000븁\x0000
Didn't I have enough power...?
I may not have enough power...\xfffeBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\xf000븁\x0000
I am training to be the very best\xfffewith my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher\xfffehas an elegant battle!\xf000븁\x0000
E-e-even though I lost,\xfffeI won't panic.
I panicked!\xfffeHere, I'll give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
Because I am a lady, I won't\xfffebe chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice smashes\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\xfffeThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\xfffeLemme...catch...my breath...\xf000븁\x0000
You and I have just met!\xfffeLet's start this game from the beginning.
I'm a little bit strong.\xfffeI will work out!\xf000븁\x0000
I got worked over...
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium!\xf000븁\x0000
You're quite strong.\xfffeYou have left the Little League!
Hey!\xfffeHey, let's practice together!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have to warn you--I will go all out\xfffeeven if we are just practicing!\xf000븁\x0000
I was no match for you...\xfffeThere is always someone better.
This is my thanks for training with me!\xf000븁\x0000
I promise you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will learn from this experience\xfffeand become an even better player!
Phew! I'll at least let my Pokémon take\xfffeit easy on their days off!
Watching a practice makes you feel\xfffethat you are stronger, too,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedoesn't it?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo let's have a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: ...I could not\xfffedo it well at all.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: ...I could not\xfffedo it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things\xfffeas if they were so simple...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the great thing\xfffeabout professionals.
We cannot have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,\xfffeand we wanted to fight as a duo, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Playing as a team is difficult.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe could do more great things\xfffeif we could understand what\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeother people were thinking!
We would like to have\xfffea Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by\xfffecoming to Small Court!!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: I got super excited!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: What a thrill!\xfffeIt's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!\xfffeI get really excited!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I played a game here,\xfffeI would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,\xfffedon't you think we will understand\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehow our star players feel?\xf000븁\x0000
We had a battle with Pokémon\xfffein the stadium...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am happy 'cause I experienced\xfffewhat star players feel!
One-on-two?\xfffeWe cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing\xfffemakes me want to get moving, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSoooooo, let's practice\xfffePokémon battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: I laugh even though\xfffewe lost because it was fun!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough\xfffefor our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle\xfffeourselves than watching\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeother people practicing!
We cannot have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,\xfffebut today we would like\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto gather our courage\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand have our own Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000
I am not good at sports,\xfffebut I enjoy sports in my own way--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon\xfffethat can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon\xfffemade me want to have a Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: Great!\xfffeYou are like a professional!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult\xfffeto fight with Pokémon as well as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe professionals do.
We are two!\xfffeWe use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do\xfffewhat I cannot do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou know how wonderful this is,\xfffedon't you?\xf000븁\x0000
Even existing sports shine\xfffewith new appeal\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have\xfffemore Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,\xfffebaseball or football?\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: The game ended\xfffebefore I knew what was going on.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: The combination play of you\xfffeand your Pokémon is great!
I love all kinds of sports!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't choose just one of them, just\xfffelike I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one\xfffePokémon that can fight?
We are always together!\xfffeOur combination play must be great!\xf000븁\x0000
Be in sync with your partner,\xfffeand with your Pokémon, too.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTag Battles are tough!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if you are in sync,\xfffeit will be very exciting!
You have only one\xfffehealthy Pokémon...?
Kids! Please cooperate with the\xfffephysical therapy for me and my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
My tackle was supposed to crush\xfffeeven Rock-type Pokémon...
This present might be more\xfffeeffective than a tackle!\xf000븁\x0000
I was injured in a rough game, so\xfffeI am undergoing some physical therapy.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!\xfffeI have plenty of guts, though!
So much guts!\xfffeHere, I'll share with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Both my Pokémon and I\xfffestill haven't gotten enough practice...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIn terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture\xfffeon the strength created by gathering\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea proper balance of different Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Bam! You lectured me!\xfffeWhat a great Trainer!
Here's a lecture, right back at ya!\xf000븁\x0000
Team play with Pokémon\xfffebrought new fun to our sport.
Ugh!\xfffeI can't take much more of this...
I am a Waiter who is good\xfffeat Pokémon battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.\xfffe...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best\xfffePokémon battles.
Welcome!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you like a cold drink\xfffewith your Pokémon battle?\xf000븁\x0000
That was a wonderful battle.\xfffeBravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted\xfffePokémon after a battle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAvailable in any vending machine!
The world is wide, and the road to glory\xfffeis full of challenges!
To have a chance to battle with such\xfffestrong Pokémon...it was worth the wait!
Impressive display!\xfffe...Shall we break for tea?
What great Pokémon you have!\xfffeThanks so much! I had a great time!
Amazing! So that's what a Pokémon\xfffefrom the city is like!
Thanks for playing with me\xfffewhile my parents are busy!
Amazing...\xfffePlease, take me away with you!
First impressions are everything!
It's not over yet!\xfffeI'll finish it my way!
I hope for a good ending! I hate endings\xfffethat leave a bitter taste in one's mouth!
Do you ever feel at a loss for words when\xfffesomething greatly moves you?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo tell the truth...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a writer, but right now I'm having\xfffetrouble putting my feelings into words.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou were just that impressive!
Now why would you use that move? If I can\xfffefigure that out, I may be able to win!
A beautiful loss is still a loss,\xfffeand an ugly win is still a win!
Even in a tough situation like this,\xfffethere must be a way to triumph!
Where there's a winner,\xfffethere's also a loser.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's pathetic to make a big deal out\xfffeof losing if you weren't prepared.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're a true Pokémon battler,\xfffeyou'll reflect upon your loss and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethink about how to win next time!
I can feel it!\xfffeYou and your Pokémon are strong!
This is my final Pokémon!\xfffeIt all comes down to this!
Everything comes down to this next move!\xfffeI'll use the last bit of my strength!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\xfffeor sole best combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why it is difficult\xfffeto keep winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I think a heart that desires\xfffestrength and strives to grow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger is a precious ideal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is why I respect you--\xfffebecause you have these things.
I have a feeling this battle will give my\xfffePokémon a chance to go all out!
I can't believe it's come to this!\xfffeI must have gotten complacent.
Ohhh, that's it! I'll go all out if it'll get\xfffeme a win!
You and your Pokémon are\xfffeboth excellent and elegant.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo have been able to battle against\xfffesuch a splendid team...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon and I learned a lot!\xfffeI offer you my thanks.
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What's this?!\xfffeThis is nothing like I expected!
Could it be?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy plans for complete and total world\xfffedomination foiled yet again?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt mustn't be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI couldn't have been defeated by some\xffferandom Trainer from who knows where!
Our battle will surely be worth a\xfffepage in the book of your journey!\xf000븁\x0000
If only I could have won, I would have\xfffebeen able to make an impression on you!
To be remembered by someone...\xfffeThat may be what it means to be alive.
I can see the plea in my Pokémon's eyes.\xfffeTo fight! And to win!\xf000븁\x0000
The eyes of your Pokémon\xfffeare glimmering with strength!
I can see the plea in my Pokémon's eyes.\xfffeThey're saying, “Get back up! I'm OK!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYep! I can understand my Pokémon's\xfffefeelings by looking into their eyes.
Wow!\xfffeAmazing!
Tcha! That all you got?\xfffeGuess it's enough...
Oh well...\xfffeLooks like I lost!
Not bad...\xfffeNot bad at all!
The ideal movement of living things,\xfffesuch pure beauty!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh, let me behold them!\xf000븁\x0000
I saw their beauty up close!
This is art!\xfffeHere--a present for you!\xf000븁\x0000
You know, creatures that exert\xfffeall their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,\xfffeI will give you something good\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom this backpack!\xf000븁\x0000
You are great!\xfffeAnd strong!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you this as I promised!\xf000븁\x0000
It feels great to run as fast as you can\xfffeover mountains and through forests.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeRight?
I came here on my journey,\xfffebut it's kind of lively here, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
Is there a festival or something\xfffegoing on here?
This is what I found during my trip.\xfffeI don't need it, so I will give it to you.\xf000븁\x0000
Everybody is dressed the same way.\xfffeIs this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied\xfffewith their games.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's how I feel\xfffewhen I watch them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe reason? If you win against me,\xfffeI will tell you why!\xf000븁\x0000
Are you pleased with your victory?\xfffeOr are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty\xfffeand so very satisfying!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how great their play is,\xfffethere is always a greater play.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am never satisfied with my bread,\xfffeeven though I bake it very well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI always want to make the next\xfffeloaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!\xfffeThat's what I heard and why I came here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's turn up the heat on this thing!\xf000븁\x0000
The heat here is too much.\xfffeI'm just burning up!
Accept this symbol of my excitement!\xf000븁\x0000
My warrior's heart is burning!\xfffeThank you for the hot battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNext, I will stay on this hot streak\xfffeand watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need\xfffeto keep their minds and bodies active,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewatching games and having battles!\xf000븁\x0000
It's so frustrating to lose!\xfffeBut it's also important to learn from it.
I just remembered something important.\xfffeCome on now. No holding back!\xf000븁\x0000
You learn more when you lose\xfffethan when you win!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are\xfffeas good as professionals!\xf000븁\x0000
The Pokémon you raised\xfffeare great, too!
You showed me your awesome Pokémon.\xfffeHere, have this as my thanks.\xf000븁\x0000
There are so many ways\xfffeto raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!\xf000븁\x0000
If I had known this would happen,\xfffeI would have worked diligently.
OK!\xfffeTime to get serious!\xf000븁\x0000
Taking a productive break\xfffeis also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.\xfffeBut there's no game going on!\xf000븁\x0000
I have a lot of work to do.\xfffeWhat am I doing here?
I'll give you this. That way,\xfffeat least I'll have done something.\xf000븁\x0000
Athletes on off days are no better\xfffethan guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children\xfffewho will become stars someday\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho are now just kids at my preschool.\xf000븁\x0000
You are also quite brilliant, but\xfffereal stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.\xfffeSo, will you please be my friend?\xf000븁\x0000
Should I get autographs now\xfffefrom children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about a battle?\xfffeThey used to call me the Cleaner!\xf000븁\x0000
I could not stop all\xfffeof your Pokémon's attacks...
Can you take this?\xf000븁\x0000
I used to be a Striker.\xfffeI was responsible for scoring goals.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow I am a sweeper.\xfffeI am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut my Pokémon are also great!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also great!
In honor of our Pokémon,\xfffeplease accept this!\xf000븁\x0000
I will strive to raise my Pokémon\xfffeto that level!
Did you see today's game?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere was some great ballhandling by\xfffeplayers and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe excitement gets me pumped\xfffefor a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but I am still excited!
I'm really excited. Here,\xfffeplease accept this gift!\xf000븁\x0000
The only place you can watch Pokémon\xfffeenjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!\xfffeSo, let's have a battle right away!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost against you too quickly!
Here, have this!\xf000븁\x0000
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!\xfffeI just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor\xfffein the audience?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, I am a Doctor.\xfffeLet's get into a battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!\xf000븁\x0000
When I am watching a game,\xfffeI just keep worrying about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from\xfffeamong so many people!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou have a good eye!\xf000븁\x0000
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...\xfffeQuite honestly, I like it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, this is for you!\xf000븁\x0000
Heehee.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven when I am in the crowd,\xfffepeople can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,\xfffebut I want to be an ordinary girl,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeat least when I am here.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't want to think about Pokémon\xfffevery much right now!
If I give you this,\xfffewill you leave me alone?\xf000븁\x0000
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes\xfffeI just want to be an ordinary girl!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to scream for the cool athletes,\xfffeand enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!\xfffeIf you can win, I will tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
Aha!\xfffeThat team will score next!
Aha! I've got it!\xfffeI'll give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
My psychic power only works\xffferight before a player scores a point.
Heheh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe team I want to win\xfffealways wins!\xf000븁\x0000
What...? Was everything up till now\xfffejust a coincidence...?
I give this to everyone who\xfffemanages to beat me!\xf000븁\x0000
Feelings matter when you cheer!\xfffeIf I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!\xfffeWhy isn't there a fishing stadium?!\xf000븁\x0000
...Of course, fishing is fun\xfffewhen you enjoy it in nature.\xf000븁\x0000
Thanks for the fun time!\xfffeHere's a symbol of my appreciation!\xf000븁\x0000
I like quiet nature,\xfffebut I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started\xfffeas Gentlemen's games!\xf000븁\x0000
Ladies and Gentlemen!\xfffeThe game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,\xfffeI will present you with this gift.\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously\xfffewhen people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefirst became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!\xfffeA lot of famous people from TV are here!\xf000븁\x0000
Athletes are all coooool.\xfffeI want to be like them.
You're so cool! I hope to be like you\xfffesomeday. Here, have this!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,\xfffeor a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.\xfffeYou must entertain the audience!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will show you the fruits of my practice.\xf000븁\x0000
While I am having a Pokémon battle,\xfffeI catch 10 balls!
Here, catch this!\xf000븁\x0000
I have mastered the technique,\xfffebut I cannot use it!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,\xfffeand squealing cheerleaders all around...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGrrr...\xfffeI am envious!\xf000븁\x0000
What is so great about popular athletes?\xfffeWhat is bad about martial artists?
My feelings as a martial artist are\xfffecontained within this. Please have it.\xf000븁\x0000
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like\xfffehai-ya and kee-up...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I had known this before, I would have\xfffebeen a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,\xfffeI will be a pro athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaah!\xfffeI will never give you my autograph!
It's not my autograph,\xfffebut I'll give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
I will practice my autograph\xfffefor when I go pro!
My daddy is\xfffean athlete here!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
My daddy gave this to me...\xfffeBut you can have it!\xf000븁\x0000
...I won't cry.\xfffe'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,\xfffein a very elegant way!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Pokémon battle is\xfffea sport in a way!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's fight elegantly!\xf000븁\x0000
O-ho-ho!\xfffeI lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball\xfffeand ordered it. Now it's yours.\xf000븁\x0000
First of all, we should enjoy\xfffesports and Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you get hung up on winning and losing,\xfffeyou lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,\xfffeand I will marry a professional athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah.\xfffeI still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give\xfffesomething good to a strong person!\xf000븁\x0000
Strong people are always totally\xfffeattractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,\xfffeand a Pokémon Trainer.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo you know what is important?\xf000븁\x0000
Grrrrrrr!\xfffeClearly you know it!
Since you know, I'll give you\xfffesomething nice!\xf000븁\x0000
Prepare thoroughly.\xfffeIf you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...\xfffeI am a star!\xf000븁\x0000
Don't look at me. I lost!
Please! I'll give you this!\xfffeJust please, don't look at me!\xf000븁\x0000
Whose autograph do you want?\xfffeDon't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!\xfffeI will punish lazy children!\xf000븁\x0000
You just don't quit!\xfffeYou are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!\xfffeTake this!\xf000븁\x0000
Nurses need plenty of stamina,\xfffeboth day and night!
My darling is working here.\xfffeHow about that? Are you envious?\xf000븁\x0000
My darling is seriously the best.\xfffeHe puts athletes to shame.
Here, I'll show the greatness\xfffeof my darling to you!\xf000븁\x0000
My darling is a Janitor!\xfffeHe cleans this entire big place\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby himself every day. Cool, huh?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,\xfffedon't they?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what Pokémon battles\xfffein rain are like.\xf000븁\x0000
Well, this place is indoors,\xfffeso they don't get rained out.
We may not get rainfall in here, but\xfffenice things can still pour down!\xf000븁\x0000
If a stadium has a roof,\xfffethey can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeI am the best Pilot in Unova!\xf000븁\x0000
You! You are daring!\xfffeBe my apprentice!
Here! I'll give you this, so\xfffebecome my apprentice!\xf000븁\x0000
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!\xfffeFly, fly, and fly away!
If you want to know what the VIP seats\xfffeare like, you'd better beat me!\xf000븁\x0000
VIP seats are very far away\xfffefrom the athletes!
VIP! VIP!\xfffeV...I...P!\xf000븁\x0000
I could see the game fine, but\xfffethe athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!\xfffeYou are a fan of that person.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can tell!\xfffeBut that person is mine!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no, oh why?\xfffeI am sorry...
I can't let you have that person,\xfffebut take this instead...\xf000븁\x0000
Come to think of it,\xfffethe more supporters there are,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe better.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou! Cheer until you lose your voice,\xfffeand clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,\xfffeI feel like I should be moving, too!\xf000븁\x0000
That was a good workout!
Oohh! I can't stop moving!\xf000븁\x0000
The stadium is nice, but I'd sure\xfffelove to play sports outdoors!
I want to drag people here\xfffeand have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Electrifying!\xfffeYou are so goooood!
To the incredible “Y...O...U."\xf000븁\x0000
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!\xfffeI will give you a good workout!
Watch a game\xfffeduring a study break!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave a battle\xfffeduring a game break!\xf000븁\x0000
Gah!\xfffeThis is so not relaxing!
I'll try doing this to see if\xfffeI can't switch gears!\xf000븁\x0000
When I come here for fun,\xfffeI can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!\xfffeIf I win against you,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will be a Gym Leader!\xf000븁\x0000
Ummmm...\xfffeMaybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
You taught me a lot, so please\xfffeaccept this as a symbol of my thanks!\xf000븁\x0000
I have to consider what I will be\xfffeby trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports\xfffeand being good at battles are related?\xf000븁\x0000
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are\xfffequite interesting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease have this!\xf000븁\x0000
Both sports and Pokémon are\xfffelike a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,\xfffewith a medicinal smell every day,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand then I get stressed out.\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!\xfffeHere's a token of my appreciation.\xf000븁\x0000
Let's have another Pokémon battle\xfffesometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!\xfffeThese are half pants!\xf000븁\x0000
You were so strong that\xfffemy half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!\xfffeHere's an awesome gift for you!\xf000븁\x0000
I envy basketball players.\xfffe'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut baseball and football\xfffeuniforms are also cool!
Mmm!\xfffeYou smell like an athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
I see. That is the smell\xfffethat strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...\xfffeOK. Please take this.\xf000븁\x0000
I hope you will get even stronger\xfffeby using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.\xfffeLet me see your skills!\xf000븁\x0000
That fighting style reminds me\xfffeof the old days!
A person like you should use\xfffetop-shelf items--like this!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how old we get,\xfffelet's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us\xfffethirsty. Right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI'll give you a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
The battle made me\xfffeeven thirstier!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you something good!\xf000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\xfffeit's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us\xfffethirsty. Right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI'll give you a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
The battle made me\xfffeeven thirstier!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you something good!\xf000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\xfffeit's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,\xfffewhich I keep looking sharp!\xf000븁\x0000
The best battle\xfffeon the best ground!
And here is the best gift!\xf000븁\x0000
OK! I will keep the grounds\xfffelooking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back\xfffememories. In those days, I was also...\xf000븁\x0000
It makes my old wound ache...
My wound aches...\xf000븁\x0000
I may not look like it,\xfffebut I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, you are not a criminal...\xfffeSorry! Lo siento!
Hey! Come on!\xfffeI'll give you this, so cheer up!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm here because I heard someone\xfffearound here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?\xfffeWait! Everybody is watching us!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, thanks to you,\xfffeI overcame my stage fright.
Well... OK, then. I'll just have\xfffeto overcome my anxiety... Here!\xf000븁\x0000
What? Nobody is watching me?\xfffeNooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!\xf000븁\x0000
You showed me your full strength!
I got it! Here, have this! I bet you'll\xfffebe able to use it to its full potential!\xf000븁\x0000
I will work at the Battle Subway\xfffefrom now on, but...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhere is it?
I want to play tennis\xfffelike a strong athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: A no-point game\xfffeagainst you 'cause you're strong...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: A no-point game\xfffe'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist\xfffeas a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeThen, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball\xfffelike a strong athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
I want to learn more from\xfffea strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeI prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!\xfffeI can fight like that!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: Fffffft...\xfffeFffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: Faaaault!\xfffeI missed a serve!
They can keep moving\xfffefor such a long time.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSmashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDid you see my power serve?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd my Pokémon is\xfffeeven stronger!\xf000븁\x0000
The person who controls his serves\xfffecontrols the game.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!\xfffeYaaaay! I won't lose, either!\xf000븁\x0000
Ai: What?\xfffeDid we lose...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCiel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and\xfffeplaying it are different!
Watching a professional game\xfffemakes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!\xfffeHey! Have a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
When professionals are playing,\xfffeit looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAthletes are looking over this way!\xfffeLet's have a battle to impress them.\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: Agghhh!\xfffeWe showed them an embarrassing scene.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Hurrah! Hurrah!\xfffeMy Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but\xfffethey were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?\xfffeNo, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,\xfffecheer for this team.\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, so I will cheer for you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHurray! Hurray! Go you go!\xfffeHustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team\xfffeis not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!\xfffeAnd the Pokémon that support it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's have a Pokémon battle\xfffeto show off my greatness!\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: The greatness of basketball...\xfffeI think you got it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Shall we curl up\xfffelike balls?
The important thing in basketball\xfffeis outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst-class athletes\xfffespeak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble\xfffefor that ball...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wish they'd fight over me that way!\xf000븁\x0000
From the ball's point of view,\xfffeit's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble\xfffefor that ball...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you\xfffewhy I like basketball!\xf000븁\x0000
Kat: Come on!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePhae: Look! Even though we lost,\xfffethe ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,\xfffeit reminds you of fruit in a basket,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\xfffeyou need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can\xfffespin a ball on my finger.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI can spin it forever!\xf000븁\x0000
I want to have Poké Balls\xfffewith the same designs as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\xfffeyou need to have two Pokémon.
Look!\xfffeMy defense is magnificent!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals\xfffeare playing, it looks so easy...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: I guess we cannot play\xfffequite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!\xfffeThat's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!\xfffeMy magnificent offense!\xf000븁\x0000
Offense that smashes in every direction!\xfffeThat's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans\xfffeis stronger than any tackle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: The bond between you and\xfffeyour Pokémon is strong, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: This feeling will go well past\xfffethe goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing because\xfffeyou can feel the excitement--the bond\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebetween players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans\xfffeis way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line\xfffeand will be heard for a million miles!\xf000븁\x0000
When I cheer for my team\xfffeuntil I get thirsty,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!\xfffeYell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.\xfffeMy friend is mainly defense.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will show you the teamwork\xfffeof football fans!\xf000븁\x0000
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon\xfffeis outstanding!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAbby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different\xfffefrom what your partner wants to do,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!\xfffePlease prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is the best way to feel\xfffethe heat of the game of football!\xf000븁\x0000
The right play can turn a game around...\xfffePokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need at least two Pokémon\xfffeto feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!\xfffeListen to the fans' drumbeat!\xf000븁\x0000
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat\xfffeof our spirit!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWeb: Thank you for listening to the yell\xfffeof our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!\xfffeNext, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!\xfffeI see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!\xfffeListen to the fans shout!\xf000븁\x0000
Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?\xfffeOh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!\xfffeListen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!\xfffeThis is the fan song I wrote!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon listening to this song\xfffetry harder than usual!\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: Olé, olé...\xfffeHuh? It's over.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means\xfffe“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!\xfffeI am cheering now!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have two Pokémon,\xfffeI don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...\xfffeShe comes 'cause she wants to sing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemore than cheering for the team.\xf000븁\x0000
I am a fan of all the players\xfffewho are doing their best!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,\xfffeit's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!\xfffeDo you know what offside means?\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: What we just saw is offside!\xfffeI bet it's offside!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: B... Baaaaah!\xfffeI won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?\xfffeEr... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you\xfffeabout the offside penalty?\xf000븁\x0000
Offside is when...\xfffeEr... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs\xfffein the bottom of the ninth inning...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAfter that... Isn't that obvious?\xf000븁\x0000
Alf: Strike!\xfffeGame over! Yes, the end!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...\xfffeWe always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,\xfffebut I do have a Poké Ball!\xf000븁\x0000
I wish I could catch a home-run ball\xfffejust once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: We're slammed.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense\xfffeis funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is\xfffetoo funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?\xf000븁\x0000
What I heard is\xfffeit means a home run.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“Homer" also\xfffemeans a home run!
We two battle together, so\xfffeyou need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't smile at my favorite player.\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: Argh! We lost,\xfffeand it's your fault.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: You should try harder.\xfffeDon't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common\xfffeis that we like the same team.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut really, isn't that the most\xfffeimportant thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you,\xfffewe're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's none of your business\xfffewho I cheer for.\xf000븁\x0000
Our teamwork is sooooo bad,\xfffeexcept when we cheer during games.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut we really don't care\xfffeabout any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing\xfffebecause you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.\xfffeI will work out today, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I... I got worked over.
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium again!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength!\xfffeYou pack quite a punch!
POWER!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have power that nobody can beat,\xfffeyou can win both Pokémon battles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand football games!\xf000븁\x0000
I...still don't have enough power?
I may still not have enough power,\xfffebut I'm not short on kindness!\xf000븁\x0000
Mmmm... Maybe I should\xfffetrain more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!\xfffeBut I have more guts than anybody else!
I've got more than enough guts!\xfffeTime to share it with others!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon and I still haven't\xfffepracticed enough...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 10...
I am stronger than ever.\xfffeI will work out today, too!!\xf000븁\x0000
I got worked over.
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium!\xf000븁\x0000
A swing and a miss...\xfffeI can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith my ripped muscles,\xfffeI will overcome everything!\xf000븁\x0000
I still don't have\xfffeenough muscles...?!
I may not have enough power...\xfffeBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\xf000븁\x0000
Maybe I should change\xfffemy training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!\xfffeI have more than enough guts, though!
It's sharing time yet again for\xfffemy copious amount of guts!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon and I\xfffestill haven't practiced enough...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.\xfffeI will work out today, too!!\xf000븁\x0000
I...got worked over!
Thanks for always coming to Big Stadium!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is\xfffehome-run class!
POWER!!!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will win! My superior power\xfffecan blaze any trail!\xf000븁\x0000
Is it possible that just having power\xfffeis not enough...?
I may not have enough power...\xfffeBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\xf000븁\x0000
Football games and Pokémon battles\xfffeboth require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!\xfffeI've got more guts, though!
I've got enough of the strongest kind\xfffeof guts. I'll share them with you again!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon and I still\xfffehaven't practiced enough...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced\xfffeand become a great player!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNow, let's play ball!\xf000븁\x0000
Game over!
Here's a gift to show my thanks to\xfffeyou for coming!\xf000븁\x0000
Now, practice, practice, practice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePracticing over and over is the best way\xfffeto be good at anything!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\xfffespecial training for my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
My block was supposed to guard\xfffeagainst even Steel-type Pokémon...
This gift might be more effective\xfffethan my block!\xf000븁\x0000
Physical therapy is over,\xfffeso we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength\xfffeof the team you create when\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou put a strong Pokémon at the core.\xf000븁\x0000
...You taught me!\xfffeYou are great!
I can give a pretty\xfffegreat lecture, too!\xf000븁\x0000
It looks like a team built around\xfffea strong Pokémon--that is, an ace--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehas advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I\xfffeare the world's strongest!!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! I didn't think anyone could\xfffecatch my blazing fastball!
Try to catch this!\xf000븁\x0000
My fastballs are so fast,\xfffenobody can hit them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeVery few can catch my fastballs\xfffeexcept Pokémon.
I, I...\xfffeI'm not fat, am I?\xf000븁\x0000
Ripped!
Ripped, I tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
I am ripped!\xfffeI am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.\xfffePoké Balls, too. See?\xf000븁\x0000
After I let Pokémon out of\xfffePoké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
Handling items is a piece of cake!\xf000븁\x0000
I should practice more\xfffeon Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,\xfffebut I want to become a better player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I will fight\xfffea lot of Pokémon battles, too!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH!\xfffeI couldn't even pass the ball!
Hey, you might be a fan of mine.\xfffeI'll give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
I will do anything to play better!\xfffeIt's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher\xfffehas an elegant battle!\xf000븁\x0000
E-e-e-even though I lost,\xfffeI will not panic.
I panicked!\xfffeSo, here, have this!\xf000븁\x0000
Because I am a lady, I won't be,\xfffewell, you know,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffech-ch-chagrined at losing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWell, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,\xfffebut I will be even better soon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice with a lot\xfffeof Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH!\xfffeMy field positioning was terrible!
But my passing technique is great!\xf000븁\x0000
If I think about why I made a mistake\xfffeand correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd if I work to improve my strength,\xfffeI'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant\xfffeall the way down to my toes!\xf000븁\x0000
Wahhhhh! What is this??
I even give gifts in an elegant fashion!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! I am a lady,\xfffeyet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,\xfffebut now I want to be the best player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice with a lot of\xfffePokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH! I missed the basket!\xfffeI was blocked!!
I'm gonna throw this item,\xfffeso you'd better block it!\xf000븁\x0000
I won't give up games!\xfffeI won't accept limits!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNobody can stop me\xfffeas long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others\xfffeto battle elegantly!\xf000븁\x0000
You should...\xfffeGo easy on me!

B-b-b-because I am a lady...\xfffewaaaah...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,\xfffeI won't smell sweaty!\xf000븁\x0000
A healthy sweat...\xfffeBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
Here's what us athletes\xfffedo as a greeting!\xf000븁\x0000
After a battle, take a bath!\xfffeAfter eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!\xfffeI will practice volleys\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\xfffeThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\xfffeLemme...catch...my breath...\xf000븁\x0000

Hey! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will strike you from above.\xfffeMy attack has a height!\xf000븁\x0000
That's right.\xfffeThe Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
How about this one?\xfffeIt's got quite a flavor!\xf000븁\x0000
We always play basketball\xfffewith Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!\xfffeWatch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!\xf000븁\x0000
Your attack just now...\xfffeMore powerful!
How about a powerful present?\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon are sending over\xfffesome powerful serves so I can practice.
Oh!\xfffeMy groundbreaking research...
You're not bad!
Nice!\xfffeYou're really good!
Oh ooohhh...
Wow!
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\xfffeJust kidding!
Ahhh, that was fun!\xfffeBut now I've got to get back to cleaning!
It's important to make a good first\xfffeimpression on your opponent!
It's the final chapter!\xfffeHere's my last Pokémon!
I really want a happy ending this time!\xfffeI hate endings that leave a bitter taste.
Wow. I'm stunned.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\xfffehow to say this... Putting my feelings\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto words would just be a trap.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\xfffethan I thought!
I never thought you would use that move...\xfffeNot a bad choice at all.
Those who give up on themselves\xfffecan never claim victory!
There's got to be a way to win...\xfffeEven in the most extreme of conditions!
Which Pokémon should I raise?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhich moves should I teach my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat items should I give my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need to think everything through very\xfffethoroughly if you want to win!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn that sense, you're a very\xfffeimpressive battler!
Oh! Strong as usual.\xfffeThat makes my heart dance!
I may have only one Pokémon remaining,\xfffebut its strength knows no limits!
I'll put everything I have into\xfffethis next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\xfffeor sole best combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why it is difficult\xfffeto keep winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I think a heart that desires\xfffestrength and strives to grow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger is a precious ideal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is why I respect you--\xfffebecause you have these things.
I will show you how harmonious\xfffemy Pokémon and I are!
Battling in extreme conditions\xfffelike this makes me stronger!
I will control my emotions and use them\xfffeas energy to help me obtain victory!
As impressive as always...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo. You and your Pokémon were even\xfffemore elegant and excellent than before!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo have been able to battle against\xfffesuch a splendid team...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon and I learned so much!\xfffeI offer you my thanks.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease battle me again sometime.
When was the last time\xfffeI was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let\xfffesuch a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had\xfffesuch a heated battle with you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou are a really great Trainer!!
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...\xfffeHow should I say? Isn't it full of...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeoutrageous and mysterious charms?\xf000븁\x0000
You've got quite a bit of charm\xfffeyourself, don't you?
Look carefully at the direction in which\xfffethe string extends from the cocoon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFind the end of the string, and\xfffeproceed in that direction!
...That's right.\xfffeI was taking a nap inside the cocoon!
You thought you could get\xfffethrough here? Think again!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr so you thought!\xfffeI'm just blocking your way!\xf000븁\x0000
My, my...\xfffeAren't you a bit too strong?
Keep this a secret between you and me...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDepending on which side you enter\xfffethe cocoon, you will come out somewhere\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedifferent on the other end.
You're just one step away from\xfffebeing able to challenge Burgh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, before that, I have to\xfffetry to stop you!\xf000븁\x0000
Your battling style is almost\xfffeas artistic as Burgh!
Burgh remodeled this Gym in order to\xfffebetter understand the feelings Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat wrap themselves in cocoons have.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Unfortunately, we can never seem to\xfffefind our way around as a result.
Strong winds, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt represents the strength of us\xfffeand our Gym Leader!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is a Pokémon Gym! Let's have\xfffeus a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I felt some intense pressure coming\xfffefrom you and your Pokémon!
I'll give you some advice.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf the floor is colored differently and\xfffeyou're surrounded by walls, you probably\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewon't get blown away by the wind.
My Pokémon is stronger than the wind.\xfffeIt's my pride and joy!\xf000븁\x0000
It may be stronger than the wind, but my\xfffePokémon isn't as strong as yours.
I became a Pilot so I could soar through\xfffethe skies alongside my flying Pokémon!
Sometimes you need to be bold,\xfffewhile other times you need to be careful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou'll have to react accordingly if you\xfffedon't want to be blocked by the traps\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein this Gym!\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't block your path...\xfffeYou're an impressive Trainer!
If you see the devices around you\xfffestart to spin quickly, you should hurry\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand find a place to hide from the wind!
If you can beat me, you'll be able\xfffeto face the Gym Leader...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're too careless if you think that!\xfffeDon't let your guard down yet!\xf000븁\x0000
How could this be?!\xfffeI wasn't being careless at all!
Landing is the hardest part about\xfffepiloting a plane. You'd better stay\xf000븀\x0000\xfffealert until the very end!
Right side clear! Left side clear!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBattle flight is ready for takeout!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeErr... I mean takeoff!\xf000븁\x0000
Unfortunately...we are forced to land.
How far can you fly in the\xfffeface of strong winds?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHigh performance is important for planes,\xfffebut perhaps feelings are what's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeimportant for people and Pokémon.
To have chosen that move...\xfffeI see! You'll be a powerful opponent!
As a Gym Leader, I aim to be a wall for\xfffeyou to overcome!
This! This is what a real\xfffePokémon battle is!
I can feel your desire to win\xfffepouring out of you!
It's not over yet! Time to turn\xfffethis show around for a victory!
Wait!\xfffeI was right in the middle of the chorus!
Lights, please! Time to show you\xfffewhat Bug-type Pokémon are made of!
Mmm... I've got a bad feeling about this!\xfffeCould I be in trouble?
Hmm... It's over!\xfffeYou're incredible!
You and your Pokémon's moves\xfffeare simply dazzling!
I've got to overcome this situation!\xfffeI can't let my fans down!
You shocked me through and through!\xfffeYou melted my heart!
Impressive!\xfffeThat's some strength you've got!
No hard feelings, but\xfffeI'm extremely stubborn!
Man oh man... It feels good to go all\xfffeout and still be defeated!
When I think about how you might\xfffeattack, it's like I'm walking on air!
Never give up! To do so is an insult to the\xfffePokémon who fight for you!
I won't forget this battle!\xfffeI'm glad that I could fight against you!
Whatever move you chose, it fills me with the\xfffeheat of battle!
My blood burns with even more fire at this\xfffeage! I've still got some fight in me!
This bitterness that floods me after\xfffea defeat...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe heart that does not succumb to such a\xfffefeeling is filled with energy and life!
Dude...\xfffeYou're really into this, huh!
Awww, dude... I know I'm about done,\xfffebut I'm still just so pumped up!
You totally rocked that!\xfffeYou're raising some wicked Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou got this Trainer thing down!
I won't forget the pain you just\xfffeput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\xfffepartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\xfffeI won't let myself forget this frustration!
I won't forget the pain you just\xfffeput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\xfffepartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\xfffeI won't let myself forget this frustration!
I won't forget the pain you just\xfffeput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\xfffepartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\xfffeI won't let myself forget this frustration!
You can tell how much your opponent\xfffewants to fight by looking into his or her\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeyes, don't you think?\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! I could really tell\xfffethat you wanted to win!
I'm gonna keep battling to make\xfffemy Pokémon stronger!
Hey, you! Have you seen my cute\xfffePokémon? Take a look!\xf000븁\x0000
My Purrloin is cute even if it loses!
Maybe I'll try a wild Pokémon next time\xfffeso that I can win...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\xfffeYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\xfffeWe can keep going!
It can't be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow could I have lost?\xfffeI need to apologize to my partner...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\xfffeYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\xfffeWe can keep going!
It can't be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow could I have lost?\xfffeI need to apologize to my partner...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\xfffeYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\xfffeWe can keep going!
It can't be!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow could I have lost?\xfffeI need to apologize to my partner...
You sure are unlucky to have\xffferun into someone as strong as me!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess it was I who was unlucky\xfffeto have run into you!
Turning bad luck into good luck...\xfffeI wish I knew how to do that.
Let's see who has the\xfffemost admirable Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Even though we lost, my Pokémon\xfffeare still pretty admirable...
If we can't win with these numbers,\xfffemaybe I should find my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesome more friends!
Oh! I haven't seen you before!\xfffeWould you mind sparring with me?\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Astounding! For one so young,\xfffeyou're quite impressive, indeed!
Look carefully around the ranch and on\xfffethe roads, and you might find items on\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe ground!
I need to get Alder to teach me\xfffesome more things...
I need to get Alder to teach me\xfffesome more things...
I need to get Alder to teach me\xfffesome more things...
What?! How could I have lost in a\xfffetype matchup like this?
What?! How could I have lost in a\xfffetype matchup like this?
What?! How could I have lost in a\xfffetype matchup like this?
You're strong! Or should I say\xfffeyour Pokémon are strong?
For knowledge to truly become your own,\xfffeyou've got to test it out for yourself!
I'm the strongest Trainer in\xfffeVirbank City's preschool!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess I'm not the strongest in the world!
I know! I'll go home and take a nap!\xfffeMom always says that I need to get lots\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof sleep if I want to be a big kid!
Hi there! Look at my awesome Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
I...I'm not mad!
My Pokémon will always be with me,\xfffeeven if we lose!
Two Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeStrong and strong come together\xfffeto become...very strong!\xf000븁\x0000
Lia: Wahh! My Pokémon can't fight\xfffeany longer?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLily: Uh oh... My Pokémon isn't\xfffelooking so well...
I don't know when I'm supposed\xfffeto use Potions and stuff...
One Pokémon all alone?\xfffeBut it'll be sad...
Ummm...\xfffeOne plus one...isn't three!\xf000븁\x0000
I heard something really cool!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are moves where two\xfffePokémon can attack at once!
One Pokémon all alone?\xfffeBut it'll be sad...
I always give it my best when I'm\xfffearound kids and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no! I'm not being a very good\xfffeexample to the kids, am I?
Every day is full of amazing, new\xfffediscoveries when I'm with children\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Pokémon!
Ahh!\xfffeHow merciless...
Get in my way, and I'll knock you out!\xfffeStay out of my way...and I'll knock\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou out, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm the one who got knocked out!\xfffeThat was exhilarating!
Hahaha! You're great!\xfffeKnock 'em all out for me, OK?
I can always be straight and honest\xfffewith myself whenever I'm playing the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeguitar or having a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh! The happy times always end\xfffeso quickly!
It's because I'm with my Pokémon that\xfffeI can happily play my guitar.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd it's because I play my guitar that\xfffemy Pokémon become strong. Get it?
Is this what it means to face reality?
I don't mind losing, but I\xfffefeel sorry for my Pokémon...
Speaking of which, it's been quite some time\xfffesince I last had a Pokémon battle.
Sure, I'll be your opponent!\xfffeRight alongside my trusty Woobat!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow!\xfffeHow powerful!
This is one of my favorite places!
All right! Time for a Pokémon battle!\xfffeLet's begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Whew!\xfffeYou're way too strong!
Time for some special Pokémon\xfffetraining in the dark tall grass!
I'm gonna get a lot stronger\xfffeso I can impress Roxie!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah haha...\xfffeIt can't be true...
I want to get a lot stronger\xfffeso I can impress Roxie!
Welcome to the Nimbasa City Gym, where\xfffePokémon and Trainers come together to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeput on magnificent Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet the fashion show begin!\xf000븁\x0000
The show has just begun...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...What? It's over already?
You and your Pokémon were\xfffepositively shining!
You can't get by with just beauty!\xfffeYou need to be a strong Trainer, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't get captivated by the magnificent\xfffebeauty of our battling style!\xf000븁\x0000
...Strong and beautiful!\xfffeYou captivated me!
Beauty isn't just about one's\xfffephysical appearance!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour strength is part of your beauty!\xfffeThat goes for both you and Elesa!
The show is approaching its grand finale,\xfffebut first I need to check if you've got\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhat it takes to stand on the same\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestage as Elesa!\xf000븁\x0000
Such strength and beauty!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou've got what it takes to\xfffeshare the stage with Elesa!
What a fantastically elegant show!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon battle between you and\xfffeElesa was absolutely magnificent!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI was utterly captivated!
You've been caught by a powerful hook,\xfffewhich is me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll have a battle with you using\xfffemy freshly caught Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I just can't help but flop about!\xfffeFlip flop flip flop flip!
I like to think that I'm not catching\xfffePokémon against their will, but that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey cling to my hook because they\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewant to battle me!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!\xfffeMy next catch will be called victory!\xf000븁\x0000
The victory that got away\xfffewas thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Life is just like fishing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can't catch what you don't aim for,\xfffebut even if you aim for something, you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestill can't catch it!
Having lots of battles is the best\xfffeway to train a Pokémon quickly!\xf000븁\x0000
Your training method is great!\xfffeI'm going to copy it!
I want to battle you each time\xfffeyou come here! Got it?
Ah, that smell?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Herdier here seems to say that\xfffeyou've got a dangerous smell about you!\xf000븁\x0000
I see... Your strength is\xfffecertainly quite dangerous...
Just because you're strong doesn't mean\xfffeyou can look down on those who aren't!
Hey there! Trainer!\xfffeLet's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you! This will prove to be\xfffea great memory of my journey!
Stick up a thumb to stop a car.\xfffeMake eye contact to stop a Trainer.
Hey, you!\xfffeStop right there!\xf000븁\x0000
There's no stopping you!\xfffeOne might call you unstoppable!
Go all out while you're still young!
What's a kid like you doing\xfffewandering around these parts?\xf000븁\x0000
To have bested an officer like me...\xfffeWhat kind of kid are you?!
An officer's job is to keep patrolling\xfffeeven when nothing's going on!
This ain't no place for\xfffekids like you!\xf000븁\x0000
Just who are you?\xfffeYou looked pretty timid...
All I know is that if you're a Trainer,\xfffeyou're gonna get challenged!
My shiny head is a reflection\xfffeof my fighting spirit!\xf000븁\x0000
My shine is set to blind!
My dumb little brother decided to follow\xfffein my footsteps and become a bad dude.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI really wanted him to grow up\xfffeand live respectably, though...
A motorcycle in the desert!\xfffeDoesn't get much more wild than this, eh?\xf000븁\x0000
Motorcycles aren't compatible with sand.\xfffeI'm not compatible with you!
Both bicycles and motorcycles get\xfffetheir tires stuck in the sand!
Starting yesterday, I decided\xfffeto become a bad dude!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNow people will know I'm strong!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess I can't just up and decide to be\xfffea bad dude... It's tougher than I thought!
I want to be like my big bro\xfffeand have a shiny head!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou don't have to waste time\xfffedrying your hair after a shower!
Hey, hey!\xfffeWe'll take care of you!\xf000븁\x0000
Rob: My...my cute little Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSal: My baby lost!
Some cute Pokémon you've got there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou aren't too shabby\xfffeof a Trainer, either!
Hrmph! I don't want to fight someone\xfffewho has only got one Pokémon that's\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeready for battle!
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong?\xfffeAre you lost or something?\xf000븁\x0000
Us bad dudes are getting together\xfffeto boast about our Pokémon!
Come on! You're telling me that you've\xfffeonly got one Pokémon ready for battle?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't call myself a bad dude if I fight\xfffetwo against one! It's not fair at all!
My gorgeous Pokémon and I have come\xfffeto frolic about Relic Castle! Here, take\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea look at my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is quite high class, indeed!
Visiting famous landmarks with\xfffemy most favorite Pokémon is a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetruly exceptional experience!
You there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've become bored, so I shall\xfffelet you entertain me!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, you certainly know how to entertain.\xfffeI thank you for your time.
All I see is sand all around me...\xfffeI cannot understand the appeal of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesuch a place!
A ruin buried under the sand!\xfffeTo have run into another Trainer here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDoesn't this give you a grand sense\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof adventure?\xf000븁\x0000
Bittersweet defeat becomes\xfffea bittersweet memory...
It's a lot of fun to imagine how people in\xfffeancient times lived their everyday lives!
What kind of Pokémon is your\xfffepartner on this journey?\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! What an amazing and\xfffestrong friend you've got!
They say that a good companion makes the\xfffejourney pleasant, but it's really true!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you're with Pokémon, the fun factor\xfffejust multiplies, don't you think?
This may be a bit sudden, but please,\xfffecheck out my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Even if my Pokémon lose,\xfffethey are still so cute!
Anytime, anywhere, no matter what,\xfffemy Pokémon are always the best for me!
Hee hee! Hey, you! Check out\xfffemy Pokémon before you go!\xf000븁\x0000
What brilliant Pokémon!\xfffeThank you for the battle!
I feel a bit down when I lose,\xfffebut I also feel that each battle with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy Pokémon strengthens our bond!
Aynshunt!\xfffeIt's aynshunt!\xf000븁\x0000
Tara: Wahh! But it's aynshunt!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeVal: No, it's a roo-in!
Aynshunt means a long time ago, right?\xfffeDoes that mean yesterday is aynshunt?
You only have one Pokémon?\xfffeYou need more! I like lots of Pokémon!
Roo-in!\xfffeIt's a roo-in!\xf000븁\x0000
A roo-in is like someone's house, right?\xfffeI wonder who lives here?
You only have one Pokémon?\xfffeIsn't it lonely?
After watching a football game, we want\xfffeto get rowdy ourselves!\xf000븁\x0000
Ava: You defeated us so soundly\xfffethat even I feel refreshed!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAya: I cheered as best I could...
Keeping track of wins and losses is\xfffeimportant, but don't lose sight of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeverything else as a result!
We can't have any teamwork if you've\xfffegot only one Pokémon ready for battle!
Knowing what a truly heated\xfffebattle is all about is the key to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetruly passionate cheering!\xf000븁\x0000
A fan needs to be 100 percent serious\xfffeabout both battles and cheering!
You can't show off your teamwork if you\xfffeonly have one Pokémon ready for battle!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.\xfffeToday, they'll help me battle you!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, my! Battling sure is much\xfffemore difficult than baking!
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we\xfffebake bread together. It's so much fun!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't mind getting up early every day.
Art is explosions! Life forces\xfffecolliding together!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
Boom!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeColors collide to form new colors!
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪\xfffeTurn around, and it's your turn.\xf000븁\x0000
Turn around, turn around, turn around...\xfffeThen turn around some more!
My Pokémon just love participating\xfffein musicals! They are masters of dance!
Whatever the case, it's best to\xfffetry something for yourself!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmm... I guess strumming instead of tapping\xfffewould have been best...
You're a strong Trainer!\xfffeI'm a great Guitarist!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWe're both pretty awesome!
I can feel it in the air...\xfffeThis battle will be electrifying!\xf000븁\x0000
What electrifying strength!\xfffeYou shocked me good!
Give this Berry to your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon holding a Cheri Berry gets\xfffehit with paralysis, it will eat the Berry\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand recover!
OK!\xfffeTomorrow will be a home run!\xf000븁\x0000
Stu: We lost! Time to walk off...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeArt: Farewell! You won...
Your Pokémon certainly have\xfffewhat it takes!
You only have one Pokémon ready for\xfffebattle? It's more fun with more friends!
Baseball and Pokémon battles\xfffeare dramas that don't need scripts!\xf000븁\x0000
To be a great baseball player, you have\xfffeto be able to hit, play defense, and run!
In the spirit of sportsmanship,\xfffeI must say you'd be at a disadvantage\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a two-against-one match!
A spot of greenery growing right next\xfffeto a big city!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTruly an oasis! I feel so refreshed...\xfffeAnd now I'd like to battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh... It no longer feels like an\xfffeoasis if I lose!
I think the big boulders in this oasis can\xfffebe moved using the Strength hidden move!
City Pokémon or\xfffePokémon that live in the forest...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhich do you prefer?\xf000븁\x0000
I love both kinds of Pokémon,\xfffebut I don't like losing!
The best place for humans to live isn't\xfffenecessarily the best place for Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, the best place for me to\xfffelive is in my bed!
This is called the battle train!\xfffeAll aboard!\xf000븁\x0000
You're the nonstop express line! I'm the\xfffelocal line that stops at every station...
Did you try out the Battle Subway?\xfffeIt's in Nimbasa City.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are a lot of unique Trainers\xfffeyou can battle. It's very exciting!
When I'm riding my Bicycle, don't\xfffeyou think I look stronger?\xf000븁\x0000
The cool breeze in my face stopped!\xfffeSo did my Bicycle!
Cycling is a sport, too!\xfffeFollow the rules and ride safely!

Analyzing the current situation\xfffeis also a part of science!
Just because a previous method worked\xfffebefore, doesn't mean it will again!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe process of trial and error!\xfffeIs that what science is all about?
I shall uncover the mechanism behind\xfffeTrainer and Pokémon relationships!\xf000븁\x0000
Why are Pokémon able to understand\xfffetheir Trainer's orders?
I wonder if Professor Rowan of the Sinnoh\xffferegion has managed to unlock the mystery\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof how Pokémon evolve.
To me, the battlefield is a\xfffeplace for learning!\xf000븁\x0000
W-wait!\xfffeI've got to analyze this defeat!
By losing, you can discover\xfffewhat your true strength is! Heh!
I need to research the Exp. Points of\xfffePokémon for my homework assignment!\xf000븁\x0000
It's not fair to use moves\xfffeI wasn't expecting!
Hmm! I see! If a high-level Pokémon\xfffedefeats a lower-level Pokémon, they\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedon't receive very many Exp. Points!

My oh my...\xfffeI lost!
I'll go home and get my boyfriend to...\xfffeNo, I'll get my Pokémon to cheer me up!

Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon\xfffealso become energetic?\xf000븁\x0000
When we are surrounded by green,\xfffewe feel more energetic. Don't you think?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThank you, Mother Nature! I love you!
Well, well, well...\xfffeIf it isn't a lost Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Sorry! I mistook you for a Pokémon!
Everyone loves playing hide-and-seek...\xfffeI have trouble finding them!
Teacher?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, you're not Teacher!\xfffeYou're a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
The tall grass is too...tall!
There's a weird Pokémon hiding in the\xffferustling grass!

Quit it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm not really a Pokémon!
I hide in the tall grass and pretend\xfffeto be a Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm what you might call a\xfffemethod actress!
The two of us make an amazing\xfffecombination! Let's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Sola: Our amazing combination\xfffehad no impact on you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAna: I can't believe it! We should\xfffehave been perfect, but we lost!
If my sister is full of energy,\xfffethen I'm full of energy, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's kind of like we have the\xfffePokémon Ability called Synchronize!
Oh, you only have one Pokémon...\xfffeIt would be more fun if you had more!
The teamwork of Twins...\xfffeA true example of perfection!\xf000븁\x0000
Even though we look the same,\xfffeour parents can always tell us apart!
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeI can't believe it... How could you?
A battle on a raised walkway!\xfffeThat's kind of cool.\xf000븁\x0000
Losing is uncool.\xfffeNo, no, you are cool.
Stand still on a raised walkway, and\xfffeyou'll lose your balance and fall!
I love raised walkways!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBalancing is fun,\xfffeso I often come here to play.\xf000븁\x0000
I lost,\xfffebut I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can\xfffemove without encountering wild Pokémon.
I'll be your opponent, but only\xfffeif you have three or more Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat are ready for battle!
We go three against three in\xfffeTriple Battles...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you ready?\xfffeI am! Let's go!\xf000븁\x0000
What?! I never even considered\xfffelosing before going into battle!
If you don't have many Pokémon with you,\xfffeyou can't enjoy Triple Battles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand it's easy to get into trouble!
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\xfffethat uses three Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease prepare at least three Pokémon\xfffefor battle!
Round and round the rotation goes!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan you keep up without having your\xfffehead spin? Rotation Battle, begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Ohhh... My head is spinning!
To have so easily emerged victorious\xfffefrom a sudden Rotation Battle...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou are cool! Too cool, in fact!
The sounds of gently crashing waves...\xfffeThe smell of salt in the air...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd a battle with a Trainer\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the prime of youth!\xf000븁\x0000
Simply excellent!\xfffeThat's what being young is all about!
I feel rejuvenated whenever I get the\xfffechance to have a Pokémon battle with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesomeone younger than myself.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's like I'm taking in that\xfffeperson's youthfulness!
Hello there, young Trainer.\xfffePlease, battle with me for a spell.\xf000븁\x0000
My oh my...\xfffeToo bad. Looks like I lost.
When I was young, I traveled all\xfffearound, together with my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, I was such a tomboy! Ah ha ha!
Hoo!\xfffeHa!\xf000븁\x0000
Gah!
...I lost! I'm sorry,\xfffemy precious Pokémon!
Number! Four! Teen!\xf000븁\x0000
OK!\xfffeThank you very much!
Whether they win or lose, Pokémon can\xfffebecome just a little bit stronger after\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeeach and every battle.
Check out my lively Pokémon, which\xfffeI've gathered from all around the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeUnova region!\xf000븁\x0000
Mmm hmm! Looks like you are\xfffeeven more lively and fresh!
As long as you've got momentum,\xfffeyou don't need experience or knowledge!
Onward, my friends!\xfffeMy Bug-type Pokémon swarm!\xf000븁\x0000
Pretty cool, huh?\xfffeMy Bug-type Pokémon are the best!
It's not like I'm collecting them, but\xfffewhen I'm with lots of Bug-type Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy lust for adventure is fulfilled!
Right now, I feel like\xfffemastering Triple Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt sure would be great if you had three\xfffeor more Pokémon ready for battle!
Let me test what fighting style\xfffeis more effective!\xf000븁\x0000
By any chance, are you a\xfffeTriple Battle genius?!
If you'd like, please have\xfffeTriple Battles with your friends.
I'm trying to get better\xfffeat Rotation Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll battle you if you have three or\xfffemore Pokémon ready for battle!
Let me test what fighting style\xfffeis more effective!\xf000븁\x0000
What are you, some kind\xfffeof Rotation Battle genius?
You should try having Rotation Battles\xfffewith your friends, too.
Kids! Please cooperate with this\xfffepractice session for my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
But my running play was supposed to\xfffebe so incredible that even Flying-type\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon couldn't keep up...
Maybe this gift will be more\xfffeeffective than my running play!\xf000븁\x0000
Having a powerful and speedy\xffferunning play is key to being a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegood football player!
I-I...\xfffeI'm not chubby, am I?\xf000븁\x0000
Big and strong!
Big and strong, I tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm not putting myself down...\xfffeBig and strong is what I'm saying!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm not chubby! I'm just big and strong!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\xfffetraining for my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
But my passing technique was supposed to\xfffebe so incredible that even Psychic-type\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon couldn't predict it...
Maybe this gift will be more\xfffeeffective than my passing technique!\xf000븁\x0000
Football is a thinking person's sport!\xfffeYou've got to outmaneuver and outwit\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyour opponent if you want to win!
I-I...\xfffeI'm not plump, am I?\xf000븁\x0000
Gotta go huge!
I'm gonna go huge, I tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm trying to bulk up so I can\xfffeshrug off any opponent's tackle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm not getting plump!
I-I...\xfffeI'm not all sweaty, am I?\xf000븁\x0000
Gotta have passion!
It's all about passion, I tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm just really passionate about\xfffebattling! I'm not just some sweaty dude!
My undefeated Pokémon and I\xfffehave our eyes set on you for\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeour practice opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
I knew I had the right person!
I'm practicing my gift-giving technique\xfffefor my fans! Here, take this!\xf000븁\x0000
I got some great practice\xfffefrom our battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll become even stronger!
Training or not, I don't hold back!\xf000븁\x0000
Impressive!\xfffeYou've got some spectacular skills!
This is a token of my appreciation!\xfffeTake it with you!\xf000븁\x0000
If I practice against strong Pokémon\xfffethen I can get even stronger!
If you're persistent in your efforts,\xfffeyou'll eventually get stronger!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's why I love practicing!\xf000븁\x0000
I especially love practicing against you!
Take this as my thanks\xfffefor practicing with me!\xf000븁\x0000
The more you practice, the better\xfffeyou'll be in an actual match!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope you keep practicing, too!
My partner and I have been through a\xfffelot together! Here we go!\xf000븁\x0000
I won't let consecutive losses get me down!\xfffeThat's my policy!
This is a token of my appreciation!\xfffeTake it with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Don't let losses get you down, either!\xfffeDo things your own way!
My right shoulder is itching to throw!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's see if you can catch my super\xfffefastball, right down the center!\xf000븁\x0000
Not even my super fastball was enough!\xfffeWell, at least I can say I gave it my all!
This is a token of my appreciation!\xfffeTake it with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Thanks to you, I feel like I can\xfffebe proud of my fastball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks so much!
My style is to use powerful Pokémon\xfffeto keep up a winning streak!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll teach you a lesson!\xf000븁\x0000
...You taught me!\xfffeYou're so powerful!
This is my thanks for teaching me!\xf000븁\x0000
I'll research some more battle styles\xfffeso I can learn to use this power\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemore effectively!
When it comes to handling the ball, leave\xfffeit to me! Same goes for Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! I guess being a skilled ball handler\xfffedoesn't have much to do with battles!
Items are your friend!\xfffeUse them with care!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm still just a beginner in the\xfffeworld of Pokémon battling!
I gathered a bunch of cool Pokémon\xfffeto make my team. I'll teach you a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffething or two about their strength\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein this lecture!\xf000븁\x0000
Bam! You lectured me!\xfffeYou are so cool!
This is my thanks for the lecture!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how cool the Pokémon is, it's\xfffeup to the Trainer to lead it to victory!
When it comes to keeping the ball, leave\xfffeit to me! My dribbling skills are perfect!\xf000븁\x0000
Of course...dribbling a Poké Ball\xfffewon't do any good!
You've got to be technical with\xfffehow you use items!\xf000븁\x0000
Soccer balls and\xfffePoké Balls...
Hey, check this!\xfffeTrap and...shoot!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmm... My Pokémon don't come out any\xfffestronger even if I give the ball momentum?
Items are important, both in sports\xfffeand in Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going to come up with a separate\xfffetraining regimen for when I practice\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battles.
The amount you sweat is a good\xfffeindicator of how youthful you are!\xf000븁\x0000
I don't care if I lose. I'm still young!\xfffeThat was a good sweat!
When you start to sweat,\xfffetry using this item!\xf000븁\x0000
My capacity for exercise is one of\xfffemy better points!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's all so I can get a good sweat!
Hey there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThink you can overcome\xfffemy tricky dribbling style?\xf000븁\x0000
Hey! Come on, watch me!\xfffeI was dribbling this whole time!
I'm gonna pass this item to you\xfffewhile dribbling at the same time!\xf000븁\x0000
I love Pokémon battles,\xfffeand I love basketball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm so lucky to be able to do both!
Young Trainer!\xfffeAre you getting enough exercise?\xf000븁\x0000
After you're done exercising,\xfffedon't forget to rehydrate yourself!
Here, I'll give you this,\xfffeso sweat with me!\xf000븁\x0000
People lose water from their bodies\xfffesimply by breathing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means that to sweat is to live!
Hey! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCheck out my long shot!\xfffeI've got serious range!\xf000븁\x0000
No one can beat me when it comes to taking\xfffea long shot, but I still have a lot to learn\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen it comes to Pokémon battles!
Short pass of an item\xfffecoming right at you!\xf000븁\x0000
There's always more to learn when it\xfffecomes to improving one's technique in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeboth Pokémon battles and basketball!
Hey there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat do you think of this ball?\xfffeI polished it until it shined!\xf000븁\x0000
I may have lost the battle, but no one\xfffecan beat me when it comes to shining balls!
I polished this item until\xfffeit shined, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Taking good care of your ball is\xfffeimportant both in sports and in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battles. Don't you think so?
My practice match is coming up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice smashes\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\xfffeThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\xfffeLemme...catch...my breath...\xf000븁\x0000
You and I have just met!\xfffeLet's start this game from the beginning.
Be in awe of my leg strength, which\xfffeI developed through relentless rallies!\xf000븁\x0000
I suppose leg strength doesn't matter\xfffemuch in a Pokémon battle...
Take this item as a gift!\xfffeBe in awe of it!\xf000븁\x0000
Train alongside a speedy Pokémon, and\xfffeleg strength will come to you naturally!
The interclub match is coming soon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice smashes\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\xfffeThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\xfffeLemme...catch...my breath...\xf000븁\x0000
You and I have just met!\xfffeLet's start this game from the beginning.
No matter how fast the ball is moving,\xfffeit doesn't escape my vision!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNothing gets past me!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength has been preserved\xfffein my mind's eye!
I hope you'll preserve this gift\xfffein your mind's eye!\xf000븁\x0000
Sometimes it's best to let the ball go\xfffeby instead of hitting it back.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn tennis, you need to be able to\xfffemake quick decisions on the fly!
My pinpoint smash is as accurate as\xfffethreading a string through a needle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThink you can handle it?\xf000븁\x0000
You happily handle any kind of attack!\xfffeWhat a big heart you have!
I'll show that I have a big heart, too!\xfffeHere, have this item!\xf000븁\x0000
You need to put everything you've\xfffegot into each and every hit of the ball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTreat each moment of your life as if\xfffeit's a match point!
I need to practice more as a\xfffePokémon Breeder.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease, be my opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
I've still got a long way to go...\xfffeI'll be raising my Pokémon!
Thank you so much!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI learned a lot from our battle.\xfffeBe my opponent again sometime!
I'm always patrolling this area!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll show you a Pokémon battle that\xfffetakes advantage of the terrain!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh! I couldn't take advantage of\xfffethe terrain... What went wrong?!
A Ranger always has one of these.\xfffeI'll give it to you!\xf000븁\x0000
The forest and the Pokémon\xfffethat live inside are alive...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomething changes every day,\xfffeso it's fun to patrol!
We are totally in sync!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUsing our amazing connection,\xfffeI will teach you all about Rangers!\xf000븁\x0000
In fact, we learned\xfffeall about you!
Do you know this Berry?\xf000븁\x0000
Listen carefully...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou may hear the sound\xfffeof breathing Pokémon and plants.
Check out my Alomomola! It took\xfffeme 100 Poké Balls to catch it!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess the number of Poké Balls I used to\xfffecatch my Pokémon doesn't mean much in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea battle...
There are other Alomomola, but I feel\xfffelike I was destined to be with this one!
Argh! It got away!\xfffeI almost caught it, too!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTimes like this call for a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Phew! I lost again, but it was nice\xfffeto take my mind off fishing for a bit!
You've got to remain optimistic if\xfffeyou want to be a good Fisherman!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeEven if your catch gets away,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethere's no use crying about it!
I am a wonderful Fisherman\xfffewho loves everything!\xf000븁\x0000
I even love a disappointing result!
I want to go deep-sea fishing\xfffeusing the Royal Unova\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat leaves from Castelia City!
Hey! What kinds of great Pokémon\xfffehave you caught?\xf000븁\x0000
Ho ho!\xfffeThese are some impressive Pokémon!
My own Pokémon are the best ones\xfffefor me! I won't compare them with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeanyone else's!
A woman standing alone with a parasol\xfffein one hand at the beach...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHi... Please have a battle with me.\xf000븁\x0000
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays,\xfffebut it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must\xfffeon the beach...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut I'm the only one who has one?
If you've got three or more Pokémon\xfffeready for battle, let's have a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeRotation Battle!
Forming a team of three Pokémon that can\xfffework well together is key in a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeRotation Battle! Let's begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no! The way I positioned my\xfffePokémon was terrible!
In honor of your great teamwork,\xfffeplease accept this Berry!\xf000븁\x0000
You really need to be able to\xfffepredict your opponent's moves\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a Rotation Battle! It's a true\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetest of a Trainer's skill!
If you've got three or more Pokémon\xfffeready for battle, let's have a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTriple Battle!
The power of three come together as one!\xfffeLet's have a Triple Battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Everyone coming together as one...\xfffeWhat great teamwork that was!
Your great display of teamwork impressed\xfffeme, so I'd like to give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
In a Triple Battle, your Pokémon have\xfffemore than triple the power!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's a true test of a Trainer's skill!
Behold my impressive physique.\xfffeIt's fitting of an Ace Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon couldn't do my\xfffeimpressive physique justice!
You can do all sorts of crazy stuff as\xfffelong as you've got energy!
To battle in a high-up place...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is the perfect situation for\xfffean Ace Trainer such as I!\xf000븁\x0000
To tell the truth...\xfffeI'm actually afraid of heights...
Overcoming one's fears is an important\xfffepart of being an Ace Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut still, I hate being up so high...
Rio and I are of one mind!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why you're going to have to\xfffeuse two Pokémon against us!\xf000븁\x0000
Cleo: Wow, what a surprise!\xfffeRio: Wow, what a surprise!
I've got to get stronger so\xfffeI can take care of Rio!
You've only got one Pokémon with you?\xfffeYou can't battle both of us like that!
It's so fun to battle alongside Cleo!\xf000븁\x0000
Being able to combine your strength\xfffewith a great friend in battle is a truly\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeamazing thing!
You only have one Pokémon\xfffethat's ready for battle?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeToo bad! Two-against-two Pokémon\xfffebattles are really fun, you know?
Travel the uneven road to hone yourself!\xfffeYou've got to train your guts!\xf000븁\x0000
You can't win just with guts!\xfffeThat's the truth of it...
You can't win just with guts, but that\xfffedoesn't mean you don't need them!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIsn't that right, Heracross?
You gotta have stamina!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBurn the flames of life,\xfffeand never stop moving forward!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm out of stamina!
I was just joking about never stopping!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need to take a break every once\xfffein a while to rest your mind and body!
I have a request for you!\xfffePlease battle me!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm mad that I lost, but I'm happy that\xfffemy Pokémon got some good experience!
Battling with you is a truly\xfffemeaningful experience!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease be my opponent again sometime!
I'm proud of my Pokémon, which\xfffeI raised with love and care!\xf000븁\x0000
Looks like I lost to you in the\xfffelove-and-care department... You're amazing!
If you don't raise your Pokémon with\xfffelove and care, they'll grow up to be\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesad Pokémon that don't want to battle!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time\xfffetogether, we don't need words\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto understand one another.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you think you can win against us?\xf000븁\x0000
You can understand each other\xfffevery well, too!
When you see this Berry,\xfffeplease remember us!\xf000븁\x0000
The best part about being a\xfffePokémon Ranger is that you get\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto spend time with Pokémon!
I trained my body and mind\xfffeby standing under a waterfall!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNothing will faze me now!\xf000븁\x0000
What...\xfffeI mean, how?
I admit your strength\xfffeand give you this gift!\xf000븁\x0000
Maybe I should train my body and mind\xfffeby standing under a waterfall!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can get clean while I'm at it!
I travel the world because\xfffeI'm looking for danger!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAre you dangerous, Trainer?\xf000븁\x0000
You're so dangerous that I was in\xfffedanger of giving up the match!
Why do I seek out danger?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause it's exciting, that's why!\xfffeIt makes me feel alive!
I might be lost right now,\xfffebut I'll battle you anyway!\xf000븁\x0000
I don't stand a chance if I\xfffefight while I'm lost.
I still have no idea what this\xfffeplace is like!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI never carry a map with me!
Join our team!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeActually, I will force you\xfffeto join our team!\xf000븁\x0000
Our team doesn't need a Trainer\xfffewho is quite that strong!
We hang out here every day!\xfffeEvery day until the end of time!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
That was just a joke.\xfffeEveryone's taking it so seriously!
Hmph! I take weak Pokémon and raise\xfffethem with tender care until they're\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegood and strong! That's my policy!
Do you want to pass through here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, you must greet me!\xf000븁\x0000
You!!\xfffeWhat great strength you have!
Chase the sun during the day,\xfffeand sleep all night...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat might be a good life for me.
Heheh!\xfffeNobody can beat my speed and fury!\xf000븁\x0000
I have lost!\xfffeI am such a loser!
Ahh! Maybe I should just pick up\xfffemy bike and charge outta here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNo one would doubt how wild I am then!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou have good Pokémon.\xfffeLet me see!\xf000븁\x0000
Jim: Ah, I get it!\xfffeThat's what you call friendship, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCas: Huh? You're saying the friendship\xfffebetween us bad dudes isn't good enough?
There are good Pokémon,\xfffebut there are no bad Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverything is up to the Trainer.\xfffeThat's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?\xfffeBut Single Battles are too boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up\xfffewith another bad one!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you know what it means?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means we are very bad!\xf000븁\x0000
Even bad men like us\xfffecan be friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat a great thing!\xfffeFriendship between men\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one\xfffePokémon that can fight?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI cannot take a cheap shot,\xfffefighting two against one!
Our sweat and tears go into this Gym...
And to think of all the walls we've broken\xfffedown up until now... To hit a wall like this...
The distance between winning and coming\xfffeclose to winning is so close, yet so far!
Everything went dark all of a sudden!
Looks like the conveyor brought\xfffein a strong Trainer like you!
I might have lost, but I'm going\xfffeto continue to believe in my Pokémon!
You didn't notice the pitfall at\xfffemy feet while we were battling?!
Hey there, young Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're unsure about something,\xfffeI'll happily act as your opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
Excellent!\xfffeThis was a defeat I can't disagree with!
I'm ashamed to admit it, but\xfffeI'm actually lost right now...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow, which way did I come from again?
If you have the move Dive,\xfffeyou can dive and sink!\xf000븁\x0000
Blub, blub, blub...\xfffe...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon\xfffelearned the move Dive?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDive is good! Great!\xfffe'Cause it's Dive!
I've been challenging the Pokémon Gyms\xfffeall across the world!\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't defeat them all, but I learned\xfffea lot at the Gyms and became stronger!
It's fine! I just want to have fun\xfffewith Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople who want nothing but to win should\xfffekeep trying until they are satisfied.
We spend our lives swimming!\xfffeOf course we battle while swimming, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many\xfffepeople can say they battled while swimming!
My Pokémon and I saw it\xfffewith our own eyes!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm talking about the ancient ruins at\xfffethe bottom of the sea near Undella Town!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves\xfffeagainst another Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis really an adventure!\xf000븁\x0000
The adventure is over already.
It appears that my vacation\xfffeshall never end.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder if that's OK...
Time for an aquatic battle in\xfffethe sea near Undella Town!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going to just float on by...
Sometimes Jellyfish Pokémon are\xfffefloating in the water around here!
I'm showing off the sea\xfffeto my beloved Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
Wow!\xfffeHow powerful!
I want to see all kinds of scenery!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can only truly have hope for\xfffetomorrow when you learn how big\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe world is and how small you are!
You see this enormous puddle?\xfffeThey call it an ocean!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa!\xfffeYou're enormous, too!
Big things are awesome! Why?\xfffeBecause they're big!
I trained with Marlon,\xfffethe Gym Leader of Humilau City!\xf000븁\x0000
I still have room to improve!\xfffeThanks for teaching me a lesson!
They say that Marlon, the Gym Leader\xfffeof Humilau City, can stay in the ocean\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefor seven days and seven nights!
What?! You're a Trainer?\xfffeAwesome! Come on, my Remoraid!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh well... Time for my Remoraid to\xfffereturn to their Poké Balls...
Pokémon just wait inside their\xfffePoké Balls until they are needed...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon sure are convenient\xfffefor us humans.
Catch this! My Pokémon is huge!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Impressive Pokémon!\xfffeEven more so than I expected!
Wailord is over 47 feet long,\xfffebut it still fits inside a Poké Ball!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThe power of science sure is incredible!
I'll have a battle with you using\xfffemy freshly caught Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I had no idea how my Pokémon would fight.\xfffeI mean, I caught them just a moment ago!
I may have just caught them, but\xfffeI'll raise them to be strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOur time together has just begun!
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm practicing my punching technique\xfffein front of the sea! Give it a try!\xf000븁\x0000
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\xfffeI won't stop punching just because I lost!
I'm training to not be fooled by\xfffethe swimming ladies...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm not just looking at them!
It takes a lot of strength to\xfffeswim in the ocean.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAre your Pokémon OK?\xf000븁\x0000
I see!\xfffeWhat energetic Pokémon!
OK! I'll replenish your\xfffePokémon's energy!\xf000븁\x0000
Everything's OK now!\xfffeCome back anytime!
Welcome! Do you have\xfffea reservation for a battle?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh my!\xfffeIt appears you reserved a victory, too!
You are great!\xfffeI want to hire you.
I just keep running around!\xfffeI've got the whole field to myself!\xf000븁\x0000
I know... I know...\xfffeI shouldn't take it all for myself.
I ran around a ton and got the\xfffeHeavy Walker Medal!
A high-level battling technique\xfffeis art in its own way!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength cannot be\xfffeput into words!
I'll draw how I want to draw!\xfffeI'll live how I want to live!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's the best way!
We've just got to do what we can!\xf000븁\x0000
I feel like I understood what I could\xfffedo and what I couldn't.
I'll try to increase the things I can\xfffedo and challenge you again!
Shut up and battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
...!
You're strong!
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.
You can learn all sorts of things from\xfffea long day spent fishing.\xf000븁\x0000
No matter what the outcome of a battle,\xfffeyour Pokémon will never leave your side.
Thinking that people and Pokémon will\xffferespect you if you're strong is\xf000븀\x0000\xfffejust a bunch of baloney, really.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe moment you lose, all those people\xfffewho were cheering for you will disappear.
How do you like riding on leaves?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you manage to beat me, I'll teach\xfffeyou something good. You'll see!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost? Now I just want to climb aboard\xfffea leaf and be swept away somewhere...
When two leaves collide, the leaf that\xfffewas moving is stopped and the leaf\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat was struck begins moving...
To be as clear as water...\xfffeThat is the style that I seek!\xf000븁\x0000
When I lose, I feel as if I\xfffemight just disappear...
I may have been the one to lose, but\xfffeI'm still going to go ahead and say it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou should definitely seek a style,\xfffebut everyone has his or her own style!
Oh! To think that you would deliberately\xfffeseek me out for a battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm so tickled that I won't hold\xfffeanything back as a reward!\xf000븁\x0000
What oppressive force...\xfffeWhat a Trainer!
Losing will only make me stronger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will use this frustration as a\xfffestepping-stone to rise again!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFor that I thank you.
It is said that water will not grow\xfffestagnant as long as it keeps flowing...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo as long as I keep moving onward...\xf000븁\x0000
I won't give up, even if I am defeated!\xfffeThat toughness is the pride of an\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAce Trainer!
When riding leaves, the direction they\xfffefloat in will depend on which side you\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegot on from.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't worry! If you keep trying, you'll\xfffefind our Leader sooner or later!
When I win, and even when the impossible\xfffehappens and I lose, I analyze every one\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof my battles to grow stronger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you really think you can beat\xfffesomeone like me?\xf000븁\x0000
I want to ride away on my Pokémon\xfffeso that I might ponder why I lost...
Riding on a beloved Pokémon and thinking\xfffeabout things is so nice that you'll find\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou come up with all kinds of good ideas.
The thing about water is that it's\xfffealways changing...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFrom the piercing strength of a jet,\xfffeto the crushing power of a wave...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's what I'm about to show you!\xf000븁\x0000
What strength...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're just as strong as Marlon...or\xfffeperhaps even stronger...?!
You know... Each Trainer has different\xfffePokémon, and Pokémon all have their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeown strengths.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've got to learn more about the\xfffestrengths of my own Pokémon!
Ugh! I'm getting really\xfffesick of losing over here!
This Pokémon I stole...\xfffeIt's no help at all!
Ah... I see...\xfffeThat was quite well thought out.
Splendid!\xfffeYou are quite the Trainer!
Don't let it go to your head...\xfffeBut you put up a good fight, kid!
What's the big idea? This Pokémon\xfffeI stole is useless!
Bravo!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat you showed us is\xfffethe spark of Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, let me say just one thing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease move on to an even greater goal.\xf000븁\x0000
I am Emmet.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI lost together with Ingo.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour combination is\xfffethe best. Perfect!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou're verrrrry strong Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...\xfffeMy name... Charles.
Ho! You fight as if you really understand\xfffeyour Pokémon!
You! So you're a Trainer who fights\xfffewhile believing in your Pokémon, are you?
Plasmaaaa!\xfffePlasmaaaa!!
The Gym Leader is tough, but you...\xfffeAre you even human?!
I tried to use the same combination as\xfffeyou, and yet...
No! At this rate, I... I won't be\xfffeable to protect the Plasma Frigate!
P-P-P-Plasmaaaa!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\xfffereal strength... How pathetic!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\xfffereal strength... How pathetic!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\xfffereal strength... How pathetic!
The fierce energy I feel from you...\xfffeIt is just like that of a soaring dragon!
Such energy on the offense...\xfffeYou are truly without equal!
The three Pokémon you picked...\xfffeThey gave me a run for my money!
Such defense...\xfffeIt is beyond comparison!
The Pokémon you picked...\xfffeThey supported each other well.
Those footsteps I have heard drawing\xfffenear... I have been waiting for you!\xf000븁\x0000
I knew as soon as I heard your footfalls\xfffethat you were a force to be reckoned with!
I had actually been meaning to\xfffegive you something.\xf000븁\x0000
I was imagining how a Burmy must feel\xfffewrapped in a cloak of fallen leaves!
Keep going with the momentum!\xfffeReady, set...fight!\xf000븁\x0000
What's with this still calm?\xfffeI couldn't win with just momentum?
I found some Berries among the fallen\xfffeleaves, so... Here.\xf000븁\x0000
I wanted to know how Pokémon must feel\xfffewhen they bury themselves underground,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso I buried myself, too!
Surprised? That's when I'll make my move!\xf000븁\x0000
Just as I'd expect!\xfffeYou're ready for anything, aren't you?
If you are prepared,\xfffeyou don't have to worry!\xf000븁\x0000
I burrowed under the fallen leaves\xfffeto become one with nature!
I'll show you the Ranger spirit that\xfffeburns with a crimson flame!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! I see your Trainer spirit also burns\xfffewith a crimson flame!
I'll offer you this in recognition of\xfffeyour spirit.\xf000븁\x0000
My red costume really goes with the\xfffeleaves over here!
What's this? A visitor? Ooh, I'm so happy\xfffeto meet someone else here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould I ask you to be my opponent in a\xfffelong-awaited Pokémon battle?\xf000븁\x0000
It's all well and good fighting wild Pokémon,\xfffebut there is a certain thrill to be found in\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebattling against another Trainer!
This house... Doesn't it seem like the\xfffefurniture just moves itself?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo! It's not me! I'm seriously not\xfffemoving it!
You... Who are you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere is another person here besides me?\xfffeWe don't need any Trainers here!\xf000븁\x0000
So you are a normal person...\xfffeA normal ⒆⒇ Trainer...
This house...\xfffeIt brims with fear, sorrow, defeat...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo many feelings fill these walls, giving\xffferise to a mysterious energy.
Feel this boiling spirit!\xfffeMy Patrat is gonna amaze you!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, this wilting spirit...\xfffeIt wasn't supposed to end this way...
This indomitable spirit!\xfffeI won't be brought down by losing!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMoving forward is all that matters!
A Triple Battle is a special battle you\xfffecan hold using three Pokémon!
Behold the strength I have perfected\xfffethrough Triple Battle!\xf000븁\x0000
How could this be...\xfffeI thought I'd perfected it...
If you want to be the best, you need to\xfffeknow the best moves and tricks for\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTriple Battles!
In a Rotation Battle, you will battle\xfffeusing three Pokémon!
It's a Rotation Battle!\xfffeWill you go right? Will you go left?\xf000븁\x0000
Is it just a lack of experience that makes\xfffeme unsure which way to rotate?
You have to make up for your lack of\xfffeexperience with intellect and reasoning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't, you will never be able to\xfffewin against more experienced Trainers.
I feel invincible because I am surrounded\xfffeby the smiles of children and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Great, great!\xfffeYou are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and\xfffeexpress your feelings to each other...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's the same for people and Pokémon.
Hey! Trainer!\xfffeHave a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon\xfffeleft to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!\xfffe...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!\xfffeHyper Beam!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoops...
A Hyper Beam? Hmm...no.\xfffeMaybe I want to do a Giga Impact now?
Trainer!\xfffeI wanna play with you.\xf000븁\x0000
Trainer!\xfffeYou too strong!
Guess what! Guess what! When I grow up,\xfffeI'm gonna ride on Reshiram or Zekrom!
When it comes to fishing, I'll do anything\xfffeand go anywhere to learn more!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'll be asking you for\xfffethis battle!\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon make a pretty strong\xfffeteam, huh?
That's right! I'd check behind every sign\xfffein the city if it was for fishing!
If I don't live with my Pokémon, a\xfffeFisherman like me won't be able to fish.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI won't be able to battle either!\xf000븁\x0000
Right now I just feel like we're so lucky to\xfffehave Pokémon!
Team Plasma...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey reminded me how important the\xfffetime is that I have with my Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'd almost begun to take it for granted.
A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.\xfffeThat is the start of a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
What?!\xfffeYou are too strong!
And I've done nothing but train my\xfffePokémon ever since I lost to that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTrainer from Nuvema Town two years ago!
Now dance gracefully!\xfffeBring forth your beautiful moves!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet us perform, my lovely Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Even though they lost,\xfffemy Pokémon are still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger\xfffeby having battles with lots of Trainers!
I've asked myself if it really is natural\xfffefor Pokémon to live with people.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI still haven't come up with an answer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut we can still battle together!\xf000븁\x0000
All sorts of feelings are stirred up\xfffeby battling.
Lose...and then accept all of the sorrow\xfffeand frustration that comes with the loss.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what it means to be a Trainer--\xfffewhat it means to live with Pokémon.
Two years ago I parted ways with\xfffemy Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYet in my heart, I've never stopped being\xfffea Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
This is the type of defeat that only a\xfffePokémon Trainer can experience!
Those lives that come into our world\xfffeas Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor me, being unsure if they really\xfffewanted to live with humans, I parted\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeways with my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut as it turns out, the time we spent\xfffetogether seems to be the best of all.
Beedrill! Volbeat!\xfffeGo, my beastly Bug-type Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use\xfffedifferent kinds of Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's fun to see, isn't it?
I always lose...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I just want to see my Pokémon use\xfffetheir moves and do their best!\xf000븁\x0000
Phew...\xfffeYour Pokémon... That was amazing!
I always lose...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut after battling so many times, I seem\xfffeto have become a little stronger!
Backpackers are exactly what they\xfffesound like.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey set out on the road with only\xfffethe packs on their backs and the Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein their Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000
I wish I could pack some wins in my\xfffebackpack, too...
The purpose of the journey is found in\xfffethose that I meet!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIsn't it great to encounter all the\xfffedifferent Pokémon there are in the world?
Hm? You're headed for the Juniper\xfffePokémon Lab, are you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWon't you have a bit of fun first?\xf000븁\x0000
You were not an opponent one could\xfffedefeat without trying!
I came all the way here wanting to hear\xfffeProfessor Juniper talk!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeShe was also a Backpacker once, so I bet\xfffewe'd have a great time swapping tales!
I am not running now,\xfffebut I usually barrel through\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas quickly as I can!\xf000븁\x0000
I have not crossed\xfffethe finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest\xfffeto give you this present!\xf000븁\x0000
Run and run in cities\xfffeand on mountain paths!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRun, and feel the world around you\xfffewith your whole being!
I choose a move, and\xfffemy Pokémon will do the move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn a moment, that move will\xfffereach your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but during the battle,\xfffewe were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect\xfffeyou and your Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
From today to tomorrow...\xfffepeople, Pokémon, and the world...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey're all connected, you know?
I wanna be like the Trainers on Route 1!\xf000븁\x0000
S-so...this is Route 1!
Pop quiz! What's so good about Route 1?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverything! It's number one, after all!\xfffeGet it?
Pokémon and people...\xfffeAnd now you and I...\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon and people...\xfffeThat's what this world is made up of.
A world without Pokémon?\xfffeI can't even imagine such a thing!
Fishermen read the flow of water\xfffeor the flow of a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
The flow of the battle...\xfffeIt's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17\xfffeis very wild.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't tap into it well,\xfffeyou cannot go where you want!
If I just dangle this fishing line here, it\xfffelooks like I'm doing something, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTruth is, I'm not doing a single thing!\xf000븁\x0000
I got caught up in it...\xfffeCaught by my own bait...
In fishing, you'll have good days and\xfffeyou'll have bad days.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut hey, losing is the mother of\xfffeall invention!
I am good at backstroke,\xfffefreestyle, butterfly...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd, of course, Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,\xfffeeven though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?\xfffeOr shall I train my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmmmm, it's hard to decide,\xfffeso I will swim with my Pokémon!
Grrrmmm... All I do lately is grumble...\xf000븁\x0000
Mrrr... Mmmrrr...\xfffeShould I try to mumble “I lost"?
I wonder what is left after all my\xfffegrumbling and mumbling?
I learned all the good points of my\xfffeClamperl and Shellder by swimming\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
What a fresh Trainer!\xfffeReally fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, everything but a place to\xfffeput my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,\xfffeI always have time for Pokémon battles!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's enjoy it as much as possible!\xf000븁\x0000
Wooosh!\xfffeSsshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have trouble with my bikini.\xfffeIt could be washed away...
When I look down from a high place,\xfffeI feel very good!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon battles are the same!\xfffeI will fight looking down from the heights!\xf000븁\x0000
You're great!\xfffeI can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,\xfffeno matter how hard it is,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe higher we climb,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe closer we get to the sky!
Down in a valley...\xfffeyou and I face each other...\xf000븁\x0000
If you were the challenger, I'm sure even\xfffeTeam Plasma would fall before you!
Even if Team Plasma had succeeded in\xfffereleasing all of the Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure that people would have just\xfffefound other ways to fight.
I would love it if you would join me in\xfffea Rotation Battle.
Your Pokémon and your strategy!\xfffeI'll be taking notes on both!\xf000븁\x0000
Now that I am a Veteran, I find there is\xfffeso much more to learn...
Stronger Pokémon than anyone else...\xfffeAn unbeatable strategy...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are no such certitudes in Pokémon\xfffebattle...and that is why it is so deep!
I come to bear upon you now like a dragon\xfffefrom above...!\xf000븁\x0000
Salamence... Even in defeat, you are the\xfffemost noble of Pokémon.
A lone island in a distant sea...\xfffeA steep and treacherous ravine...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, this is what the noble and powerful\xfffeDragon-type Pokémon is like.
What's this? You don't seem to have\xfffethree healthy Pokémon.
I may have been a Trainer for a very long\xfffetime, but I haven't gotten rusty!\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't battle the way I pictured it in\xfffemy head...
My skills may not be rusty, but it seems\xfffemy spirit might not be up to snuff...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGetting too used to things is frightening.
Oh no, I won't let a precious training\xfffepartner get away that easily!\xf000븁\x0000
A battle against a Trainer really is the\xfffebest training!
Looking for training partners over here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wouldn't say no to a girlfriend, either!
Fights have their own rhythms!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder whose Pokémon\xfffecan fight rhythmically.\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon!\xfffeTheir movements are right on the beat!
If my rhythm and the Pokémon's rhythm\xfffeare in sync, then I'm plenty happy!
Ahhh! I've got my precious Litwick, so how\xfffecould I possibly lose?
Target acquired!\xfffeTermination will now begin!\xf000븁\x0000
I was terminated...?\xfffeWhat a Trainer!
We in Team Plasma are trying to keep all\xfffethe world's Pokémon for ourselves!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we succeed in doing that, then world\xfffedomination wouldn't be a stretch!
Our king is gone...\xfffeBut we are still here!\xf000븁\x0000
...Ugh.\xfffeSeasickness is the worst...
We changed our uniforms so if the king\xfffecame back, he would know without\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea doubt that he didn't belong here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat traitorous little punk!
How about we see how well I can use this\xfffePokémon I got!\xf000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaa!\xfffe...Hmph! No good, huh?
They said that if I joined Team Plasma, I\xfffecould get powerful Pokémon and do\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhatever I liked!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut this Pokémon I got...\xfffeIt's useless!
Aren't you pretty confident, waltzing\xffferight into the enemy's stronghold!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh! No wonder you're so confident with\xfffethat kind of strength!
Those idealistic fools who thought they\xfffewere saving Pokémon are all gone.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll of us left here are real thugs\xfffewanting to take over the world!
Hi there! I'm a Pokémon thief by trade!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmph!\xfffeI missed my chance to grab your Pokémon!
I will continue poaching Pokémon! I've\xfffegot to be at least a little stronger!
...I trained myself endlessly for two\xfffeyears to get justice for Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI won't lose to anyone anymore!\xf000븁\x0000
...But if I lose, I won't be able to carry\xfffeout my justice!
My plan for justice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will carry it out no matter what anyone\xfffesays! No matter what!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNot that you'd know anything about that!
The fighting furies:\xfffewe are Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
What's a strong Trainer, huh?\xfffeJust someone who uses their Pokémon?!
Strong Trainers don't care anything\xfffeabout their Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey're just bullies who force them to\xfffeget stronger no matter how hard it is!
I will use Team Plasma's science to bring\xfffeout my Pokémon's greatest power!\xf000븁\x0000
Why are you strong? You're just a normal\xfffeperson...not even that! You're just a kid!
We in Team Plasma force our Pokémon to\xfffeuse their powers to the max!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRelease Pokémon? Why would we do\xfffesomething so bothersome as that?
Pokémon Trainers are nothing more than\xffferestraints on the legs of their Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
What?! You can actually draw out the power\xfffeof your Pokémon?!
...If Pokémon stay with Trainers, they'll\xfffebe soft and won't ever be able to draw\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon their true power.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Do you think that is true?
Everyone who isn't in Team Plasma is\xfffean enemy!\xf000븁\x0000
...I hate you!
I hate the world! I don't need a world\xfffethat doesn't recognize me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'll mess with you all as a\xfffemember of Team Plasma!
Intruder sighted!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll have you know that the Pokémon I'm\xfffeabout to use was stolen from a child!\xf000븁\x0000
...What a weak Pokémon.\xfffeI'll just have to go steal some better ones!
If we steal Pokémon, the number of\xfffeTrainers in the world will go down.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThen we won't have any more enemies!
In my own way, I'm a strong part of this\xfffeTeam Plasma group!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePeople call me the Bisharp woman!\xf000븁\x0000
Great plans are\xfffealways interrupted.
You getting in our way means that you\xfffefind us worth the time, doesn't it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Being ignored would make us feel\xfffeawfully lonely.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEr, no, I mean even if you get in the\xfffeway, we'll take over the world this time!
Even if we don't have our hero anymore,\xfffewe still won't lose!\xf000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeGlory to Team Plasma!
Maybe if Team Plasma can take over the\xfffeUnova region, our king will come back...
I won't tolerate people\xfffewho have different ideas!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh...\xfffeI won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people\xfffewho have different ideas!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf Team Plasma takes over the world,\xfffethen everyone will think the same way!
It's not just our outfits that have\xfffechanged around here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're not living for the Pokémon anymore,\xfffebut for ourselves!\xf000븁\x0000
Whyyyy...?
Our king abandoned us...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe couldn't survive unless we changed\xfffethe way we thought...
Target acquired!\xfffeTermination will now begin!\xf000븁\x0000
I was terminated...?\xfffeWhat a Trainer!
We in Team Plasma are trying to keep all\xfffethe world's Pokémon for ourselves!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf we succeed in doing that, then world\xfffedomination wouldn't be a stretch!

I repeat! We won't tolerate people\xfffewho have different ideas!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf Team Plasma takes over the world,\xfffethen everyone will think the same way!
It's not just our outfits that have\xfffechanged around here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're not living for the Pokémon anymore,\xfffebut for ourselves!\xf000븁\x0000
Whyyyy...?
Our king abandoned us...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe couldn't survive unless we changed\xfffethe way we thought...
Where do you think unfulfilled dreams go...?
That's right... We can't force Pokémon to\xfffebattle out of hatred...
What... Can it be that love is even stronger\xfffethan hatred?
Why? How could this be?\xfffeHow could you try hard for someone else?!
Cleaning actually takes a lot\xfffeof strength...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn other words, I've been training real\xfffehard by doing all this cleaning!\xf000븁\x0000
Oops! Who cares about winning or losing!\xfffeThat spot over there is what's on my mind!
When you clean, do you ever feel like\xfffeit's never going to end?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWorks for me! That means I can clean\xfffeforever, and I sure love cleaning.
Hey! Trainer!\xfffeI'm cleaning here, so out of the way!\xf000븁\x0000
Why, I'll be!
As long as folks live, they make messes.\xfffeAs soon as they do, I clean 'em up!
Sine, cosine, tangent!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmm. A tautology.
What a catastrophic theorem!
I'm a researcher studying about the\xfffesmell here!\xf000븁\x0000
If I were to express this disappointment in\xfffescent, I'd put it on par with a Gloom.
Even odors that might seem awful to\xfffehumans might be perfume to a Pokémon.
Whooooa!!\xf000븁\x0000
I loooost!!
Isn't it fun how shouting out in a sewer\xfffeor a tunnel makes your voice echo?
Humans need sewers, but what\xfffeabout Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTake that question, and take this battle\xfffechallenge with it!\xf000븁\x0000
There appears to be no barrier between you\xfffeand your Pokémon!
Since we built this sewer, all kinds of\xfffePokémon have gathered here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's like there's no boundary between\xfffePokémon and people, right?
Yahoooo!\xfffeIf you call, I'll come right away!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm on fire, baby! On fire!
Riding a Bicycle is fine, but I want\xfffeto ride away on a Pokémon!
Shift gears and Bob's your uncle!\xfffeYou'll be going full speed in no time!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how I shift gears, it looks like\xfffeI'll never be able to match your speed!
Whee! Mountain biking is tough--but\xfffethat's why it's so fun!
The path of karate is the path of\xfffehumanity...and the path of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oof! It is not by chance that you have won!
Winners win because they deserve to win!
I, Black Belt Rich, will never turn my\xfffeback and run!\xf000븁\x0000
...Ugh!\xfffeSometimes you must retreat to win!
I will reexamine my own weaknesses.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt times I may hate myself for doing so,\xfffebut I cannot run from myself!
Greetings!\xfffeSo...shall we do this?\xf000븁\x0000
What an upset!
Hmm... I just can't act naturally when I\xfffefocus on winning!
My training will never betray me. After\xfffetraining this much, I am certain to win!\xf000븁\x0000
...How can that be?\xfffeEven after I trained so much!
Defeat leads to enlightenment.\xfffeI realize now my own deficiency...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I will not make excuses! I will use\xfffethis knowledge as fuel for tomorrow!
Hey, hey, hey!\xfffeIt's all because of havin' love for\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYeah, you know what I mean.\xfffeCome on! I'm gonna have you battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Man, your love for your Pokémon hit me\xfffelike a ton of bricks!
Wouldn't it be nice to give your Pokémon\xfffea little something?\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon are always standing by their\xfffeTrainers, right?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou have no idea how lucky we are!
I hold no grudge, whether I win or lose.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe point of battle is to train\xfffemy Pokémon, after all.\xf000븁\x0000
...Awww!\xfffeBut I really wanted to win!
Gimme a Berry, gimme a Berry!\xfffeGimme a Persim Berry!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon really go into a funk when\xfffewe don't win, though.
Oh! A person!\xfffeI haven't met another person in so long!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're a Trainer, aren't you?!\xfffeThen let's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh? Maybe my instincts have grown dull\xfffeafter so long...?
The roads around here are really very\xfffecomplicated, so hardly anyone ever comes\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethis way.
I've been waiting for this!\xfffeWaiting for this very moment!\xf000븁\x0000
I had been waiting for such a strong Trainer\xfffeas yourself!
I've been waiting for this!\xfffeWaiting to give a gift to someone!\xf000븁\x0000
I've been lying in wait for ages beside a\xfffehidden item.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAn Amoonguss couldn't have pulled off a\xfffebetter ambush...right?
O Trainer, embarking on the path to\xfffeVictory Road!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWon't you show me your true power?!\xf000븁\x0000
You didn't have to show me quite that\xfffemuch power...
If you have that much power, though, I'm\xfffesure that you can use one of these!\xf000븁\x0000
If you climb the stairs, you'll reach the\xfffeBadge Check Gates...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeVictory Road lies right before you.
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,\xfffeso I won't lose!\xf000븁\x0000
I could not protect my pride.\xfffeI'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm really proud of what\xfffeI have achieved in my life!
Challenging the Pokémon League, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's no wonder you might feel a bit\xfffenervous, but you've just got to believe\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein your Pokémon and do it!\xf000븁\x0000
Am I really going to be all right with only\xfffethis trifling power...?
When you feel uneasy or afraid, just hug\xfffeyour Pokémon real tight!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you do that, you'll be fine.\xfffeIt'll just melt away all of your worries!
Cute Pokémon or tough Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhich kind do you go for?\xf000븁\x0000
See, I like the cutely tough ones!
Most people think that Rock- and Steel-\xfffetype Pokémon are all tough looking.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut there are some cute little round\xfffeones as well, you see!
The tunnel to Twist Mountain is complete!\xfffeI heard that and came running!\xf000븁\x0000
I never heard that there were Trainers\xfffethis strong, though...
Apparently the soil here in this tunnel is\xfffequite like that in the ruins in Hoenn...
Ex! Ca! Vate!\xf000븁\x0000
Jack! Ham! Merrrr!
Excavate! Jackhammer!\xfffeThey're manly sounding words, right!
We dig and we dig until we break through!\xfffeWhat could be waiting on the other side?\xf000븁\x0000
You broke through!
Sweat dripping, chips flying,\xfffecrushing through rock and stone!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis is when I really feel alive!
Even after we finish constructing this\xfffetunnel, my Drill Pokémon won't ever stop!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey can't be stopped!\xf000븁\x0000
You stopped my Drill Pokémon?!
Watch our Pokémon's dynamic forms as\xfffethey crush through the bedrock!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't imagine ever building another\xfffetunnel without the help of Pokémon!
Chili: Augh! You got me!\xfffeYou and your Pokémon are on fire!
Cress: Lose? Me?\xfffeI don't believe this!
Cilan: ...Huh.\xfffeLooks like my timing was, um, off?
I get it! Ohhh, I really get it!\xfffeBut then... So that's how it is!
I get it! So a Pokémon's strength really has\xfffea lot to do with its Trainer, doesn't it?
The research that I spent my whole life on\xfffewas all for naught?!
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what is this?!\xfffeP-P-P-P-P-P-Plasmaaaa!
The longer you live, the more opportunities\xfffefor failure.
It is the same for anyone...\xfffeAs long as you are dreaming, the dream\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill never reveal itself to you.
It doesn't bother us a bit if\xfffethe stolen Pokémon cry or beg.
It doesn't bother us a bit if Pokémon\xfffewin or lose.
It doesn't bother us a bit if we have to\xfffeuse another Pokémon after one is defeated.
You may not find treasure by digging, but\xfffeyou've still made a new road in the end.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAugh, you caught me saying something\xfffemushy! Battle will hide my shame!\xf000븁\x0000
Phew...\xfffeThat was enough for me to overlook it.
I've been thinking... If we dig too much,\xfffewill the whole Unova region collapse?
Keep on digging! We'll keep digging until\xfffewe reach the underworld!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey, you! If I beat you in battle, you've\xfffegot to help with the digging!\xf000븁\x0000
Urk!\xfffeYou don't pull your punches!
If we keep expanding down here, Clay\xfffewill literally be an underground boss!
We step now into a new world...\xfffeWhat kind of dangers await?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWill you be able to make it through?\xf000븁\x0000
Well, shoot!\xfffeKeep going then!
You, who have the strength to move on...\xfffeTake these with you.\xf000븁\x0000
I wonder if order is being preserved\xfffebetween Pokémon and humans.
You will keep moving forward to wherever\xfffeyour curiosity leads, won't you?\xf000븁\x0000
You've got an inexhaustible supply of\xfffecuriosity, haven't you!
To curiosity without end!\xfffeHere's your reward. Wonderful.\xf000븁\x0000
Surprise! Excitement! Awe!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan you even imagine what must be waiting\xfffefor you up ahead?
Just being here fills me\xfffewith magical power...\xf000븁\x0000
You seem to be\xfffefull of magical power, too...
In ancient places, magical\xfffeenergy remains...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can understand it.\xfffeSo much sorrow and joy...
My Psychic-type Pokémon\xfffejust started making noises.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs that because we're in the ruins...\xfffeor is it because of you?\xf000븁\x0000
So...strong!\xfffeWho are you?!
Relic Castle...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeApparently people and Pokémon came\xfffetogether here to create Unova.
...When I am here, I feel like I might\xfffebe crushed by sorrow.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou there...\xfffeLet us have a bout!\xf000븁\x0000
This bout...\xfffeI will not forget it...
This castle will be buried by the sands\xfffeand forgotten in time...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhenever that sad fact strikes me, tears\xfffenaturally course down my face...
I'll knock you down with mountain power!\xf000븁\x0000
Your power is off the charts!
As great as a mountain... That's right!\xfffeI'll become a mountain man!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, wait, I suppose I already am!
Whooo!\xfffeMoun-TAAAIIIN!\xf000븁\x0000
Let the scales fall from your eyes!
Mountains are sacred places.\xfffeI am here to purify my heart and mind.
If you had three Pokémon, then we could\xfffedo a Rotation Battle!
I will read your mind and predict your\xfffeevery move!\xf000븁\x0000
Your moves...\xfffeThey are entirely unpredictable!
I am a Trainer who fights as freely as the\xfffeclouds drift in the sky!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo not stiffen up on me!
A Triple Battle is a three-against-three\xfffePokémon battle!
Heh heh! I wonder what would happen if I\xfffehad all three Pokémon attack at once?\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't pick a target to focus on...\xfffeOr, rather, you never let me pick one!
A flood of attacks from three Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI know! “Jetstream" attack!\xfffeLet's call it that.
Hold on. You there...\xfffeAre you looking for the Magma Stone?\xf000븁\x0000
How about I tell you everything I know\xfffeabout the Magma Stone?
Well, there's this Magma Stone in\xfffeStark Mountain, yeah?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou move that, yeah? Then if you put\xfffeit back where it belongs, they say the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelegendary Pokémon Heatran will appear.
You see those pointy stones you find\xfffehere and there? Are you aware of them?\xf000븁\x0000
That marvelous power of yours...\xfffeI was not aware of it!
Droplets of water containing lime keep\xfffedripping down for hundreds of years...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThen they harden into stone cones.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThose are what we call stalagmites!
I can feel the energy that overflows\xfffefrom the earth!\xf000븁\x0000
I felt the energy that overflowed\xfffefrom your Pokémon!
Take this!\xfffeEarth's energyyyy!\xf000븁\x0000
Geothermal heat and abundant minerals...\xfffeYes, volcanoes hold the planet's energy!
Battle in a volcano!\xf000븁\x0000
You're super strong!
Here! For you!\xf000븁\x0000
Volcanoes are called “kazan"\xfffein my language!
Hold on. You there...\xfffeAre you looking for the Magma Stone?\xf000븁\x0000
How about I tell you everything I know\xfffeabout the Magma Stone?
Well, there's this Magma Stone in\xfffeStark Mountain, yeah?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou move that, yeah? Then if you put\xfffeit back where it belongs, they say the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelegendary Pokémon Heatran will appear.
I can feel the energy that overflows\xfffefrom the earth!\xf000븁\x0000
I really felt the energy that overflowed\xfffefrom your Pokémon!
Take this!\xfffeEarth's energyyyy!\xf000븁\x0000
Geothermal heat and abundant minerals...\xfffeYes, volcanoes hold the planet's energy!
Battle in a volcano!\xf000븁\x0000
You're super strong!
Here! For you!\xf000븁\x0000
Volcanoes are called “kazan"\xfffein my language!
How is magma created?\xfffeCan you answer that?!\xf000븁\x0000
That power! That pressure!\xfffeThat is the answer!
So strong pressure deep underground\xfffeliquefies stone and turns it into magma...
When I am surrounded by rocks,\xfffemy spirit goes up!!\xf000븁\x0000
When I lose,\xfffemy spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.\xfffeI'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?\xfffeWhy do you fight?\xf000븁\x0000
Your past experience...\xfffeIs that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,\xfffethe stronger you'll be.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe more you dig,\xfffethe bigger the hole will be...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have a purpose,\xfffethere's no wasted effort!
I've found a strong-looking Trainer\xfffeduring my patrol!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGo, Sigilyph!\xf000븁\x0000
It is just as I had thought!\xfffeA monstrously strong Trainer!
You see my Sigilyph?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt always seems to want to take the\xfffesame exact route, but why is that?
Let's see you take a powerful attack\xfffefrom veteran Workers like us!\xf000븁\x0000
We've trained by doing physical work.\xfffeSo even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that\xfffelets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,\xfffeand this old man changes in every battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Go easy on...\xfffea grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSnow on Twist Mountain...\xfffehas an indescribable beauty.
See the combination of my cool Ice-type\xfffePokémon and my hot fighting spirit!\xf000븁\x0000
It looks like you can also make an\xfffeice-and-heat combination!
Twist Mountain is cold all year round!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a great place for Ice-type Pokémon\xfffethat are happy in the depths of winter!
Hold up, youngster!\xfffeA battle will help you warm up!\xf000븁\x0000
Hah! Battling gets me so warm that I'm\xfffeeven sweating!
You can feel my face if you don't\xfffebelieve me. See? Dripping with sweat!
Heavy labor is a breeze when you let a\xfffePsychic-type Pokémon take care of it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow I can slack off and take it easy!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, I see... If a Trainer starts slacking,\xfffeit'll be his or her Pokémon that suffer.
A real Worker works together with their\xfffePokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou cannot just make Pokémon do all the\xfffework while you slack off!
It has been two years since I secluded\xfffemyself here on Twist Mountain...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow I will take this chance to test the\xffferesults of my training!\xf000븁\x0000
Even the most intense training does not\xfffenecessarily guarantee victory...
If there are those like myself who\xfffededicate their lives only to training...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen there are those like you who\xfffegrow through your journey?
Triple Battle is a new kind of battle\xfffewith three Pokémon!
OK! I will show you the results\xfffeof my daily workouts!\xf000븁\x0000
The result of my daily workout...\xfffedidn't really show up.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going to train my Pokémon properly\xfffeand make sure they grow balanced.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBwahaha! It's the challenges that make\xfffelife worth living, whatever your age!
Twist Mountain's number one tactician!\xfffeThat's me!\xf000븁\x0000
Maybe I shouldn't have been satisfied with\xfffejust being number one in Twist Mountain...?
Thank you...\xfffeWith our battle, my eyes have\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeen opened.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBeing number one of Twist Mountain\xfffeis only a stepping-stone on my journey!
A Rotation Battle is a battle using\xfffethree Pokémon!
In Rotation Battles, it's also important\xfffeto know when NOT to rotate.\xf000븁\x0000
I've been training for Rotation Battles for\xfffetwo years now, but it's still not enough...
I'm sure that Grimsley would've\xfffeknown when to rotate...
A lake that spreads beneath the earth...\xfffeAnd the Hiker who waits beside it!\xf000븁\x0000
You have seized victory with ease,\xfffeyoung Trainer...
This lake was formed by the water from\xfffeunderground rivers...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch a clear, flawless blue...
Hold up! Did you know this path was\xfffesupposedly made ages and ages ago?\xf000븁\x0000
S-sorry...\xfffeI just got so excited...
Did people really make a tunnel this long\xfffeall those ages ago?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo, they must have had many Pokémon\xfffehelping them with the work.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr they might have been forcing the\xfffePokémon to help...
It's “The Waving Weaving Walk"--\xfffeWawalk for short!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what kind of Pokémon\xfffewe'll meet today?\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon have good Abilities,\xfffedon't they?
I totally loved the Wawalk TV show, but\xfffethey took it off the air.
First, one big last gulp...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHold your breath!\xf000븁\x0000
Puaaahhh!\xfffe...Holding your breath is really tough!
The air that I just breathed in...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt could actually be really ancient air\xfffethat hasn't changed for ages, you know?
Hello, lo, lo!\xf000븁\x0000
I, I, I...\xfffeLost, lost, lost!
Echo, oh, oh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour voice really echoes in a path like\xfffethis one, huh?
My path and yours...\xfffeThey cross here and now...\xf000븁\x0000
Now that I think about it, I've come\xfffequite far...
I am going wherever I can have glorious\xfffebattles against new people...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt sounds quite daring, doesn't it?
The fact that you are here means...\xfffethat you are also part of the sewer?!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAll right! Then I will survey you, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh...? Where am I?\xfffeWho are you?
What?! You mean that I got so\xfffecaught up in my survey of the sewer\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat I ended up in the Relic Passage?!
The sewer and this Relic Passage...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs it really simple coincidence that they\xfffeexist so close to each other?\xf000븁\x0000
No, there must be a reason why...\xfffeOh! When did I lose?
Modern men make sewers,\xfffeancient man made these paths...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHave there always been people who just\xfffecouldn't get enough of digging holes?
I'll borrow this ruin's power to...power\xfffeup my own psychic...powers!\xf000븁\x0000
So I couldn't just expect that to make my\xfffePokémon more powerful, too...
The one thing you CAN borrow to get\xfffestronger is a Rental Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOops. Did I just say something I\xfffeshouldn't have?
It's coming... It's coming!\xfffeThe ancient spiritual power!\xf000븁\x0000
The ancient power!\xfffeThe sacred power!
I feel an extraordinary power emanating\xfffefrom up ahead!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes! It is a power that burns as warm and\xfffebright as the sun!
All right, let me introduce you\xfffeto the other super-cool and cute\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemember of my band!\xf000븁\x0000
If we don't recruit more members,\xfffethe sound won't have enough depth.
You're a strange kid!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven though we lost, I think my Pokémon\xfffehad fun. Look, it's even smiling!
Here I go!\xf000븁\x0000
Your style is electrifying!
You know what? At first I would practice\xfffereal quiet so I wouldn't be a bother to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Pokémon living here...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut then guess what happened! Lately\xfffethe Pokémon come and listen to me play!
This Hiker wandering the expanses of\xfffethe world will teach a child like you the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeharshness of life and the difficulty of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
The teacher was schooled...\xfffeYou're very strict, aren't you?
Sometimes Pokémon are inside dust clouds!
It is the way of greeting high in the\xfffemountains and down in the caves.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! We each get out our\xfffePokémon, and then we begin!\xf000븁\x0000
Farewell...\xfffeFarewell, my victory...
Long ago, Pokémon and people\xfffelived separately.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd now we live all together like this...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know if it is a good thing or not,\xfffebut it will surely lead to many changes.
This cave is full of rocks\xfffegenerating electricity!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThe electricity is charging me up!\xf000븁\x0000
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are\xfffemy precious Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis has been scientifically proven!!
I love this place! The electricity\xfffecharges up my inspiration!\xf000븁\x0000
Aha!\xfffeThat made a lightbulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,\xfffeelectric signals travel in the body!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, when a person has an inspiration,\xfffeelectric signals travel to the brain!
I am a Pokémon Ranger, here to gather\xfffeup some electric power!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! Can I still not draw forth my\xfffeelectrifying powers?!
Take this.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't know if it's unfair or just plain\xfffecool when Pokémon use electricity!
There was a whisper on the wind that told\xfffeme of your coming!\xf000븁\x0000
I will become the wind and blow...
Oh! I almost forgot!\xfffeI found some Chesto Berries, so...\xf000븁\x0000
Wind blows into caves when you're\xfffeclose to an entrance or exit.
The magic number is three! You need\xfffethree healthy Pokémon who can fight!
Behold the destructive force created\xfffeby my three prized Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Your combined force as a team is greater\xfffethan ours!
Perhaps I need to meet my Pokémon head-\xfffeon... Then we could be a stronger team!
I researched on the PC the best way\xfffeto battle, and now I'm sure to win!\xf000븁\x0000
Seriously?
What I found on the PC was just someone\xfffeelse's idea and not an answer that I had\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecome up with myself...
For a Rotation Battle, you've got to\xfffehave three Pokémon, you know!
My three beloved Pokémon will make their\xfffedebut in a perfect, weaving triangle.\xf000븁\x0000
You were the one who had the stronger\xfffecombined power as a team?!
With Rotation Battles, do you think that\xfffemaybe you need some Pokémon that can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetake attacks, not just deal them out?
Hey! My Pokémon are great.\xfffeLook, look!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh!!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but\xfffethat doesn't sit well with me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe'Cause I just love Pokémon,\xfffeand I just want to be strong!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,\xfffewhat we do is, of course,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeengage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no...\xfffeI'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of\xfffeguidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?\xfffeYou want to have a battle with me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll right!\xfffeI have a strong Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
That's right.\xfffeThe Pokémon is no longer with me.
...That's not true.\xfffeAs long as I remember,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit will be with me forever.
Let us have our Pokémon battle with\xfffegentlemanly reserve!\xf000븁\x0000
Ho, ho, ho! Quite the affront!
I have enjoyed every day I spend with\xfffemy Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf only my Pokémon feel the same way,\xfffethen I can die happy!
Oh my, what a young Trainer.\xfffeIf it's all right, why don't we battle?\xf000븁\x0000
There at the end, I nearly called out my\xfffelate Pokémon's name...
Is it a good thing to forget your Pokémon\xfffeafter they are gone?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOr is it better when you cannot forget?
Let's show the resting spirits\xfffethe dazzling splendor of life!\xf000븁\x0000
Hm...?\xfffeWas that a spirit just now?
When I come to Celestial Tower,\xfffestrangely, I feel the urge to fight.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes it broadcast some sort of signal\xfffethat makes me want to fight?
I'm here to understand the end\xfffeof the world, but I don't quite get it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I have a battle,\xfffewill I be enlightened...?\xf000븁\x0000
The end...\xfffeIs that it?
People, Pokémon...\xfffeEven if the world is gone,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat is not the end.
Indescribable energy\xfffeis flowing to me!\xf000븁\x0000
The energy is escaping...\xfffeAww...
The thoughts and wishes of the Pokémon\xfffethat rest here also provide energy!
...I still want to fight!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe wandering spirits are\xfffestill commanding me!\xf000븁\x0000
Hah... Hah...\xfffeThe spirit just left me.
So many voices fill this tower,\xfffeeternally silenced...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIf only someone would just listen...
I love Bug-type Pokémon, and I love\xfffebug catching!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course I looove Pokémon battles, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I won't lose to anyone when it comes to bug\xfffecatching, yet I...
If I catch all of the Bug-type Pokémon in\xfffethe Unova region, I can get a Bug-type\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCatcher Medal!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what I'm aiming for!
My Pokémon's poison really stings!\xf000븁\x0000
What a defeat!\xfffeI guess I got a taste of my own poison!
A little sting, and then the slow\xfffedrain begins...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe super-technical way that Poison-type\xfffePokémon attack is so cool!
I was taught by Master Cheren himself\xfffehow to battle with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Nooo way!\xfffeYou're stronger than Master Cheren?!
The more that you study Pokémon, the\xfffemore you'll understand them.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's, like, way too much fun!
We'll put together our power to fight!\xfffeTwo is better than one!\xf000븁\x0000
Rae: You're even more in sync than we are!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUla: Boo-hoo-hooo! We lost!
I have to watch out for my sister's\xfffePokémon when we battle.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm the big sister, after all!
We're still pretty small, so we can only\xfffestand up to others by working together.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why we battle with two Pokémon\xfffeat the same time!
Two! Two! Two is better!\xfffe...But what's “better" mean?\xf000븁\x0000
I still don't get a lot of things...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut Pokémon are cute, and battling sure\xfffeis fun!
Mommy and Daddy told me that I have\xfffeto play fair.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you've got to have two Pokémon to do\xfffea Double Battle!
My Pokémon are gonna steam you out!\xf000븁\x0000
We haven't lost in terms of dampness...\xfffeI'm gonna keep believing that!
It sure is great to be all sodden.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWho was the one who got to decide that\xfffebright, airy places are best?
Is that a Pokédex?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'd love it if you would show me\xfffelots of different kinds of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
...!\xfffeI've never seen a Pokémon like that.
Hmm... I wonder if I would meet some new\xfffePokémon if I went to the swamp?
Rotation Battles are battles\xfffewith three Pokémon!
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were\xfffeyour footsteps, weren't they?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo cute!\xf000븁\x0000
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThose whose footsteps make a splish and\xfffea splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
Triple Battles use three Pokémon!
If you turn a parasol around,\xfffeit's like a flower blossoming in the rain!\xf000븁\x0000
Whee! I'll spin around my parasol and send\xfffesome water droplets flying your way!
On rainy days, use a parasol,\xfffewear a coat, or get wet.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo as you like!
Real Fishermen are impatient!\xfffeSo we must battle immediately!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeIt's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen\xfffeare so impatient?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause we change places frantically\xfffeif we cannot catch Pokémon!
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,\xfffeand knowing the surroundings...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's a Ranger!\xf000븁\x0000
Knowing your opponent is a difficult feat!
Do you know about this?\xf000븁\x0000
If you know what kind of wild Pokémon\xfffeinhabit an area, you can bring along\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon who are strong against them and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill have no problem moving ahead.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship\xfffewith their battles!\xf000븁\x0000
This feeling of defeat...\xfffeis like a bottomless swamp...
Lum Berries make a great token\xfffeof friendship!\xf000븁\x0000
Stay still and listen carefully!\xfffeHear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe breath of trees and swamps.
If there are Trainers,\xfffeI just have battles with them.\xf000븁\x0000
I've never seen\xfffesuch a strong Trainer!
I'll battle with anyone.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause they may show me Water-type\xfffePokémon I've never seen.
Just a little bit more...\xfffeI just need that spark!\xf000븁\x0000
...I've done it!\xfffeThis haiku will be my magnum opus!
I see myself there,\xfffereflected in the still lake.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeA silent defeat...
Strength that goes beyond mere Abilities...\xfffeYou there! You're a real tough one, huh!
More!\xfffeLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I still have my last friend...\xfffeWe won't ever give up!
I will accept my friend's pain as my own and\xfffedo this!
The love for your Pokémon permeates\xfffeevery cell of your body. I felt it!
More!\xfffeLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I still have my last friend...\xfffeWe won't ever give up!
I will accept my friend's pain as my own,\xfffeand the move I will choose is this!
The love for your Pokémon that permeates\xfffeevery cell of your body. I accept it!
Why don't you prove to me how much you\xfffeand your Pokémon are capable of!\xf000븁\x0000
You are capable of far more than we are!\xfffeThat has certainly been proven!
There actually wasn't any need to prove\xfffehow strong we are.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI already know how capable my Pokémon\xfffeand I are!
I'll use my psychic powers to release my\xfffePokémon from its Poké Ball!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, that didn't go the way I wanted it to!
I hear that Caitlin of the Elite Four is\xfffean amazing Psychic.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'd sure love to face her head-on...
You... Who's brought you this far?\xf000븁\x0000
It's your reliable Pokémon who brought you\xfffethis far, isn't it?
You know what I think? All people know\xfffewhat they can do alone, but...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are a lot of things you can only do\xfffewith Pokémon, too!
You are no ordinary opponent...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is what my Ghost-type Pokémon is\xfffewhispering to me.\xf000븁\x0000
My premonition was spot on!\xfffeI knew you were no ordinary opponent!
Could it be that you and your Pokémon\xfffeare the ones emitting that strong aura?!
It's not enough for me just to be\xfffetogether with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to win!\xf000븁\x0000
Ugh! How... How...\xfffeHow could you defeat me this utterly?!
It's not enough for me just to be\xfffetogether with Pokémon! I want to win!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I do know that some people feel at\xfffeease just by being with their Pokémon...
Our unity won't be bested by anyone!\xf000븁\x0000
We couldn't win...\xfffeBut that's all right.
My Pokémon was once stolen by\xfffeTeam Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm just so grateful that we can be\xfffetogether like this now.
Wait!\xfffeYou, young Trainer over there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLook at my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Not bad!\xfffeI like your strength.
I'd love to brag about my Pokémon, but it\xfffewould take too long, so I'll resist!
I am a Doctor!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have Pokémon in bad shape...\xfffeLet me see your Pokémon in battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is fathomless!\xfffeI am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy\xfffeor not, I'll restore them to full health!\xf000븁\x0000
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut my first step will be to become the\xfffebest Doctor in Unova.
Behold the blinding brilliance of my many\xfffeGym Badges!\xf000븁\x0000
Your skill is too brilliant to behold!\xfffeIt's so bright that I can't see anything!
That Badge you have there...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo, it is your skill and the Pokémon with\xfffeyou that are so brilliantly shining!
Something about you reminds me of that\xfffeTrainer from two years ago...\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, that mix of kindness and power is just\xfffelike that Trainer!
I wonder where that Trainer is now...
The people who pass by here\xfffehave such different moods!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's fun to watch, and even more fun\xfffeto fight against them!\xf000븁\x0000
Mwa haha!\xfffeIt's fun!
Your Pokémon was in a really good mood\xfffethe moment that you won!
Are you sure? I'm strong, you know.\xfffeYou still want to take me on?\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, I'm sure... I'm weak, you know.\xfffeWhy did you want to take me on?
Not wanting to admit my own limits,\xfffeI am continuing to battle on...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's right! At least I'm persistent!
Are you sure you want to seriously take\xfffeon someone like me, who seriously fights\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith her Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000
This is the pain that comes from seriously\xfffefacing someone head-on...
I battle seriously, because I am after\xfffeserious strength.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's nothing worse than a\xfffehalfhearted opponent.
All right! You look like an opponent who\xfffewill really highlight my weaknesses!\xf000븁\x0000
Now I see my faults clearly! If I can work\xfffeon them, I'll be even stronger!
Accept your own weaknesses. That\xfffeis the first step to getting stronger.
All I want are powerful Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't comprehend this!\xfffeHow could my partner lose?!
All I want are powerful Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnly a Pokémon that understands that\xfffecan become one of my partners!
Life is all about overcoming hurdles!\xfffeCould you be a hurdle for me?\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't overcome the hurdle you\xfffepresented to me...
If you can't overcome a hurdle, you can\xfffealways just go around it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHead up here, and you'll find the\xfffegreatest hurdle for Trainers:\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe Pokémon League.
One, you are a Pokémon Trainer.\xfffeTwo, I am an Ace Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePut them together, and it's obvious that\xfffewe are going to battle!\xf000븁\x0000
One, you won!\xfffeTwo, I lost...
One, I'm strong.\xfffeTwo, you're stronger.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePut them together, and you are clearly\xfffea stronger Pokémon Trainer than I am!
I want to show how much I love Pokémon\xfffeby winning!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't show my love for Pokémon if I go\xfffeand lose!
I-I can't express my gratitude toward\xfffemy Pokémon except by winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat should I do?
The endless cycle of wins and losses...\xfffeWill it always continue?\xf000븁\x0000
Every win and loss is a precious memory.
Fighting together with a young kid like\xfffeyou makes me feel young again myself.
I'm gonna numb you and your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Unbelievable!\xfffeI was the one struck numb...?
This is the best thing for when you're\xfffereally numb.\xf000븁\x0000
A fighting style overflowing with power or\xfffea strategy that excels technically...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt depends on the Pokémon, see!
A heated battle is good, but get too hot\xfffeand you might end up getting burned!\xf000븁\x0000
Amazing...\xfffeI think I got a bit singed.
If you get burned, be sure to use this!\xf000븁\x0000
Burning competitiveness and cool logic...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou'll need both if you're going to go\xfffeup against the Pokémon League.
I just felt a great wind...\xfffeAre you the one who kicked it up?\xf000븁\x0000
This defeat will also be blown far away...
You are the wind.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA supple and comforting wind blowing\xfffethrough Victory Road!
I am...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEx-Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Eek! You are like that Trainer from two\xfffeyears ago!
There are some people who don't love\xfffePokémon even if they're strong.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd there are some people who love even\xfffethe weakest Pokémon.
You bothered to come all the way here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGood! I will reward your hard work by\xfffebattling with all of my strength!\xf000븁\x0000
A battle with a good Trainer fills my heart\xfffewith warmth.
The fact that you made it out here...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's it! It must have been thanks to a\xfffePokémon carrying you with a hidden move!
Hey, since you worked so hard to get\xfffehere, how about I be your opponent?\xf000븁\x0000
Thanks a bunch.\xfffeIt was a lot of fun!
My Pokémon lets me ride on its back as\xfffeit uses Surf or Waterfall.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI really feel its love at those times!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\xfffecommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\xfffecommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\xfffecommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\xfffecommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\xfffecommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
I hate to admit it, but...\xfffeYou're a good Trainer.
Have you gotten even stronger than you\xfffewere in Lacunosa Town?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHow, in such a brief amount of time...
You little...\xfffeYou knocked out my stupid pawns!
Even if I lose, I will not give up on justice\xfffefor Team Plasma! That's all!
Argh! Lame! Stupid! Fool! Plasmaaaa!
The pain of my Pokémon...\xfffeI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\xfffemy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\xfffeNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\xfffeI did my best, but we lost...
Why was I so conceited as to think I could\xfffeshow you anything?
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!\xfffeRoller coaster!
What!\xfffeMy victory was taken away from me!
As a Doctor, I will be examining your\xfffePokémon's strength!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! What's this?\xfffeIt is the very picture of health!
Before you go, let me give your Pokémon\xfffea little booster shot!\xf000븁\x0000
Feel free to drop by anytime your\xfffePokémon need a little TLC!
I'll battle Pokémon even if I can't find\xfffea pulse!\xf000븁\x0000
It wasn't just a pulse I couldn't find...\xfffeI couldn't get the prize either...
I may have lost the prize, but I'll still\xfffemake your Pokémon healthy and hearty!\xf000븁\x0000
To make people healthy,\xfffeDoctors go where they are needed.
You need a Nurse's help?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSure, if you can win against me,\xfffeI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\xf000븁\x0000
Come on!\xfffeYour team is really healthy!
OK! Then...\xfffeTime to give your Pokémon some energy!\xf000븁\x0000
Making Pokémon feel better--that's what\xfffeI am here for!
People with a strong life force look so\xfffevibrant and alive!\xf000븁\x0000
Your life force is positively blinding!\xfffeUgh! What is this?!
All right, here I go!\xfffeLife force to the max!\xf000븁\x0000
You guys push your life force to the max!\xfffeJust keep on pushing boundaries!
I'm wandering the world trying to find a\xfffeplace where I belong...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHow about you?\xf000븁\x0000
I lost...\xfffeSo this isn't where I belong either...
You don't just find your place in\xfffethe world. You've got to make it!
If you want to know what I've got in my\xfffebackpack, why don't you try to beat me!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoaaa!\xfffeI'm going to be buried!
My backpack is full of sand from\xfffethe desert.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's my job to dig out Relic Castle before\xfffeit gets completely buried!
A desert is like one giant sandbox, right?\xfffeSo come on, let's let our Pokémon play!\xf000븁\x0000
Since this is for play, whoever has the most\xfffefun is the winner!
How about I just make a huge sandcastle\xfffein the place of that old Relic Castle\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat's getting buried?
No matter how desperately I try to scoop\xfffeup the sand, it flows through my fingers.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's kind of sad somehow...\xf000븁\x0000
Victory slips away...\xfffeYes, just like the sand...
These words are meant for you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBe careful, but never be afraid of\xfffethe journey.
I will show you the harshness\xfffeof the desert through a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!\xf000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon gets a burn,\xfffeit also weakens physical attacks.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis works quite well!
Scorching desert!\xfffeA passion for adventure!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd a heated battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial\xfffeto treat a burn!\xf000븁\x0000
Whether it is hot or cold,\xfffethere is no problem if you have passion!
I will use my supernatural powers to\xfffehelp my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! That's amazing!
Drawing out your Pokémon's power\xfffelike that...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think that is a real\xfffesupernatural power.
Hrmm... You're strong, aren't you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's kind of tough when you know that\xfffebefore you even start to fight.\xf000븁\x0000
Urk! It's almost as if I didn't have ESP...\xfffeI can't do anything against you.
I like to play tag with my Pokémon\xfffewhen they use Teleport.
I am a Trainer before I'm a Nurse!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am itching for a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I was so itchy that I couldn't\xfffefight properly!
OK, let's get you all fixed up!\xfffeJust leave it up to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Be careful of sandstorms as you explore\xfffethe Desert Resort!
My great loves in life are...\xfffeMountains! Food! Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut food deserves to go in there twice!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, ho ho!\xfffeYou got me!
When you pick the simplest-looking path,\xfffeit often turns out to be a dead end.
I'm chasing my dream,\xfffeand I'm fighting for a victory!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't catch that dream!
There was once a legendary Pokémon\xfffehidden away in this cave.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat do you think it felt?\xfffeWhat do you think it was hoping for?
If there is a steep cave in the east,\xfffeI go there and train my Pokémon, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeif there is a strong Trainer in the west,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI go there and challenge that Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon clearly lack\xfffeproper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf they live in rugged wilderness,\xfffethat can happen naturally.
Wait a sec!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me grip my Poké Ball a little\xfffebit tighter.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Yeah, like that! Now I'm good!\xf000븁\x0000
Squeeze!
If you hold your Poké Ball tight when\xfffeyou're feeling unsure, your Pokémon will\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecheer you on!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'm OK!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!\xfffeThey are the best in the world!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also cute,\xfffebut my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon\xfffeis the best in the world.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNobody can beat it.
I'm planning on transferring a Pokémon\xfffeusing Poké Transfer.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut before I do...\xf000븁\x0000
Phew... I should have just transferred\xfffemy Pokémon after all, huh?
To meet your Pokémon beyond the\xfffeconstraints of time and distance...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe desire to meet like that has sure led\xfffeto some amazing inventions, huh?
Huh? Your Pokémon...\xfffeThey escaped from Poké Transfer?!\xf000븁\x0000
Sooorry!\xfffeI took you for someone else!
The Poké Transfer is an amazing device\xfffethat allows you to transport Pokémon.
When you embark on a journey, you\xfffediscover many joys...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat will I discover fighting you?\xf000븁\x0000
The joy of victory and sorrow of defeat--\xfffeboth gone in an instant...
I learned this lesson when I got to the\xfffeend of my journey.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoy can be fleeting.\xfffeBut true happiness never ends...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeJust as your Pokémon will never leave.
I've got lots of items in my backpack!\xfffeI'll use them well to secure victory!\xf000븁\x0000
When you have too many moves and items, you\xfffecan actually end up a bit overwhelmed...
If you're overwhelmed, throw 'em away!\xfffeYou don't want to be weighed down when\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou're traveling.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAll you really need is your Pokémon.
Hi, hi! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will let you see\xfffewhat kind of Pokémon I have!\xf000븁\x0000
Oooh, quit bugging me!
I'll bring out all the great sides of Bug-\xfffetype Pokémon for everyone to see...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm gonna be just like Burgh someday!
Hi, hi! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease show me what kinds of Pokémon\xfffeyou are training!\xf000븁\x0000
Great, great! I didn't know\xfffethat way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be\xfffestronger, but if you don't let it evolve,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit will learn moves quicker.
Hey, Trainer! Let's have a refreshing\xfffebattle and blow away all my troubles!\xf000븁\x0000
You guys...\xfffeYou feel like an unbeatable combination.
I've been thinking lately.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven if I were somehow separated from my\xfffePokémon, would they choose me as their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTrainer again...?
Oh my! My Pokémon really seem raring\xfffeto go today!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I guess that means I'll be asking you\xfffefor a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
It seems my Pokémon weren't\xfffeas ready as I thought!
Pokémon are alive, just like you or me, so\xfffeit's no wonder that they might feel down.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhen that happens, just let them take\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit easy.
I trained and trained like a madman,\xfffeand my Pokémon trained even more!\xf000븁\x0000
Yeah! Yeah!\xfffeEven though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!\xfffeI train it to smash the challenge rock!
I test the challenge rock\xfffewith my fist every day!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt is important to make steady progress,\xfffelittle by little.\xf000븁\x0000
I still have not\xfffetried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day\xfffewith my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy don't you check out\xfffethe challenge rock\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I'm the one who patrols Pinwheel Forest\xfffefrom one end to the other!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeA battle here is a piece of cake!\xf000븁\x0000
What a huge mistake to lose\xfffea battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.\xfffeI'll give it to you!\xf000븁\x0000
The forest is alive...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomething changes every day,\xfffeso it's fun to patrol!
Melding into the wild landscape...\xfffeThat's what a Pokémon Ranger does!\xf000븁\x0000
I am such a weakling!\xfffeI will disappear back into the wilderness!
I'm sure you can fully\xfffeutilize this.\xf000븁\x0000
If you blend into the wilderness too well,\xfffeyou won't be noticed by Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelet alone by people.
Haaah... Whoooosh...\xfffeHaaah... Whoooosh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK! After deep-breathing exercises\xfffecomes the time for a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
All that I can do now is sigh in sorrow...
But I can also do this!\xf000븁\x0000
Different Pokémon can be found\xfffein different places.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes that mean there is\xfffea perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature\xfffewithout opposing it.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is the strength of Rangers!\xf000븁\x0000
What great power!\xfffeYour Pokémon are marvelous!
This is one of the powers\xfffeI got from nature.\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon are just too amazing, so we\xfffeend up depending on them for everything.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGreat power can be dangerous.
I came here because this place feels\xfffequite nostalgic to me...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut now I'd rather battle with you than\xfffestroll down memory lane!\xf000븁\x0000
I see... So that's it.\xfffeI used to also be that focused long ago.
I am reminded of my childhood and chasing\xfffeinnocently after Bug-type Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was that day, in this very place, that\xfffeI started on the path to “Trainerhood."
Let me show you the Pokémon that I\xfffemet by fate!\xf000븁\x0000
The Pokémon that you've met are quite\xfffeformidable, aren't they?
Young kids sure have it good.\xfffeThey get to meet all kinds of Pokémon!
Shorts and Pokémon!\xfffeThis is the ultimate combination!\xf000븁\x0000
It's not my Pokémon's fault!\xfffeIt's not my shorts' fault either!
I'm wearing shorts to help toughen up\xfffemy kneecaps! Do you want to feel them?
My Pokémon's strong points!\xfffeYou'll see them if you fight!\xf000븁\x0000
Hey! Did you see\xfffemy Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know, 'cause there are too many!
You...are a rather adult-looking kid...\xfffeA kiddish adult... Oh, jeez!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll just find out when we battle!\xf000븁\x0000
You are a childish and adult and altogether\xfffemysterious Trainer!
A precocious child or a childish adult...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBoth can be hard to deal with, but both\xfffeare also cute in their way!
The forest is full of little hollows and\xfffehillocks, and walking in it is so fun!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd you know, having Pokémon battles is\xfffeeven more fun!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are soooo cool!
I want to ride through the forest on a\xfffePokémon!
Oh! And I just heard a Pokémon, too!\xfffeOh, boo...\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon seemed kinda happy, Trainer!
There are Pokémon hiding beyond\xfffethose bushes!
Instead of a Dragon-type Pokémon, I've\xfffefound myself a spectacular Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
You were spectacular and, more than that,\xfffeso strong!
I'm going to like Dragon-type Pokémon\xfffebecause I want to talk to Drayden!
We're best friends!\xfffeOur Pokémon are best friends, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Ally: Even if we lose...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAmy: ...We'll still be best friends!
We're gonna be best friends forever and\xfffeever, right?
Bring two Pokémon here, OK?\xfffePretty, pretty please!
Our Pokémon are best friends, too!\xf000븁\x0000
We play with two Pokémon!\xfffeIt just won't work with one!
After all, the two of us are like\xfffeone person!
We feel filled with power when we're\xfffesurrounded by our beloved stone!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh stones!\xfffeThis can't be stooone!
I'm not the only one who gets excited by\xfffeall this stone--my Pokémon do, too!
Oh! Trainer!\xfffeDo you want to learn a bitter lesson?\xf000븁\x0000
Training complete!\xfffeI think I may've improved a bit.
No need to rush!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm just a normal person, so there's no\xfffeway I can become the best all at once!
...Are you sure you want someone like me?\xfffeOne moping around in a place like this?\xf000븁\x0000
If only he was also as strong as you are...
When you like someone, you try to show\xfffethem your good points, don't you?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, I went and thoroughly beat the guy\xfffethat I liked in a Pokémon battle...
I've overcome my fear of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Mm-hmm! You really love Pokémon, don't you?
There are people who are afraid of\xfffePokémon, too.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThough everyone seems to forget that.
Just three more people!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI won't leave this spot till I win against\xfffethree more people!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa!\xfffeYour Pokémon were amazing!!
Heh! If beating an opponent is also a kind\xfffeof strength then...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess sticking to something you've\xfffedecided to do is also a kind of strength!
These Pokémon were born\xfffeon the same day and raised together!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh!\xfffeYou're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon\xfffeare full of happiness, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeour joys will grow as we live together!
...So what.
I'm just a shadow, after all...
How disappointing...
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeI lost! This is awful!
I may look like a regular Clerk ⑮, but\xfffein fact I am a glamorous female spy!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCan you feel it? How strong I am?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! This spy has failed her mission!
I am investigating the new CEO as part of\xfffemy work as a female spy.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll find out what he's hiding!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut he couldn't really be a child,\xfffecould he? That's just ridiculous!
I've got to reach my quota.\xfffeThat's why I'm challenging you.\xf000븁\x0000
Ohhh... I lost, but I've also come up with\xfffea brilliant proposal!
As part of the Battle Company, we office\xfffeworkers have to complete many Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebattles and fulfill our quotas!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\xfffemove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\xfffeYou're really something!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\xfffemove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\xfffeYou're really something!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\xfffemove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\xfffeYou're really something!
Battling against you always gets me\xffferiled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
Battling against you always gets me\xffferiled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
Battling against you always gets me\xffferiled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
My Pokémon seems to be in pain!\xfffeMy partner's pain is my pain!
I can feel it! Our minds are one right now,\xfffeme and my partner's!
Just as I'd expected! You are really\xfffedrawing forth your Pokémon's power!
My Pokémon seems to be in pain!\xfffeMy partner's pain is my pain!

My Pokémon seems to be in pain!\xfffeMy partner's pain is my pain!
I can feel it! Our minds are one right now,\xfffeme and my partner's!
Just as I'd expected! You are really\xfffedrawing forth your Pokémon's power!
S-s-still... That's fine.\xfffeWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\xfffeI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\xfffeIt was a lot of fun!
S-s-still... That's fine.\xfffeWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\xfffeI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\xfffeIt was a lot of fun!
S-s-still... That's fine.\xfffeWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\xfffeI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\xfffeIt was a lot of fun!
I will use everything that I've learned in\xfffemy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\xfffeput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\xfffeYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned in\xfffemy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\xfffeput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\xfffeYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned in\xfffemy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\xfffeput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\xfffeYou are really great.
That pressure I felt from you just now...\xfffeWhat was that?!
What a blunder to have made\xfffein front of Zinzolin...
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
When those triplets at Striaton\xfffeRestaurant go back to being Gym Leaders,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll be the first in line to challenge 'em!
Real battle is the best way to learn!\xf000븁\x0000
I'll learn from losing, as well!
If you're working toward a goal, then\xfffeanything can be a chance to learn!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...That's what Cheren said before he\xfffebecame the Gym Leader.
I'm going to review everything I learned\xfffein the Trainers' School!\xf000븁\x0000
I'll have to work on that move some more...
What kind of person is that Cheren guy\xfffeat Aspertia City's Trainers' School?
This is a power spot!\xfffeIt awakens your dormant power!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you spot my weakness?
Long ago there was this Pokémon called\xfffeMusharna here that could eat dreams...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand even make dreams real, or so\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepeople say.
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,\xfffeand I was running away from you.\xf000븁\x0000
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,\xfffebut I lost!
You can't help but to chase after what\xffferuns and to want what you can't have!
Let us conduct some Pokémon research.\xfffeYes, let us show each other our Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Mm, mm! A new discovery and an\xfffeever-deepening mystery...
The more you research, the more you\xfffecan discover.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut with Pokémon, you can become friends\xfffeeven without understanding everything.
The mysterious psychic power! You cannot\xfffesee it, yet it is definitely there!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh! It's always like this!\xfffeI cannot see what really matters!
The hole in a donut... There is nothing\xfffethere, and yet it exists. I love that!
Going through trials is the best for\xfffegrowing stronger!\xf000븁\x0000
You were the perfect trial!\xfffeI mean, come on, you're so strong!
We raise our Pokémon by having\xfffethem battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I'll be asking you for a\xfffePokémon battle every time you come here!
My serve is 120 miles per hour!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the kind of killer attack I'm\xfffeabout to show you!\xf000븁\x0000
Ohhh, I wanted to continue the rally just a\xfffelittle bit longer!
A rally that goes on for ages--it's\xfffetough but still so fulfilling!
Watch my furious tennis footwork!\xfffeYou get it now? We're really tough!\xf000븁\x0000
But...but I'm tough enough to go all day\xfffeand all night...
Someday I want to play a doubles match\xfffewith pairs of people and Pokémon.
If only you had three Pokémon that were\xfffeready for battle!
Oh! You look pretty good!\xfffeLet's play some pickup!\xf000븁\x0000
That's game!\xfffeYou totally crushed me.
I wanna play at Small Court in\xfffeNimbasa City someday...
You don't even have three healthy\xfffePokémon? That's just odd!
Fooling you fair and square!\xfffeThat's what we call a trick play!\xf000븁\x0000
What the hoops?\xfffeI was the one who was tricked!
How are you gonna get past an opponent?\xfffeThat's vital for battles and basketball.
See my extraordinarily pretty Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Ahh! Its fire has been weakened?!
When you feel a Pokémon breathing, you\xfffecan really feel how alive they are!
L-E-T-S-G-O! Let's go! Let's go!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe cheer on any Trainer who tries\xfffehis or her best!\xf000븁\x0000
May: Go, go, Pokémon!\xfffeMal: Fight, fight, Trainer!
The Trainer's commands call out!\xfffeThe Pokémon's moves are decided!
There're two of us, right?\xfffeSo we wanna fight with two Pokémon!
Let's go! Let's go! L-E-T-S-G-O!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe cheer on every Pokémon that fights!\xf000븁\x0000
If the Pokémon and the Trainer don't\xfffeboth do their best, they won't win!
We love Double Battles! Understand?
I fight for my love of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Your love of Pokémon really came through...
That's your love of Pokémon!\xfffeHere's my love of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
My love of Pokémon will always make them\xfffefeel better.
Are people from the outside all so strong?
Have we just been ignorant of the world?
There's nothing left for me to say after a\xfffebeating like that!
More!\xfffeLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
For the sake of my friend who saved me, I\xfffewill never give up!
You've got to value this time that you\xfffehave to get to know each other!
Your Pokémon are happy...\xfffeThey are happy to be with you.
More!\xfffeLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
For the sake of my friend who saved me, I\xfffewill never give up!
You've got to value this time that you\xfffehave to get to know each other!

You've got to value this time that you\xfffehave to get to know each other!
Your Pokémon are happy...\xfffeThey are happy to be with you.
To have chosen that move...\xfffeI see! You'll be a powerful opponent!
As a Gym Leader, I aim to be a wall for\xfffeyou to overcome!
This! This is what a real\xfffePokémon battle is!
I can feel your desire to win\xfffepouring out of you!
It's not over yet! Time to turn\xfffethis show around for a victory!
Wait!\xfffeI was right in the middle of the chorus!
Lights, please! Time to show you\xfffewhat Bug-type Pokémon are made of!
Mmm... I've got a bad feeling about this!\xfffeCould I be in trouble?
Hmm... It's over!\xfffeYou're incredible!
You and your Pokémon's moves\xfffeare simply dazzling!
I've got to overcome this situation!\xfffeI can't let my fans down!
You shocked me through and through!\xfffeYou melted my heart!
Impressive!\xfffeThat's some strength you've got!
No hard feelings, but\xfffeI'm extremely stubborn!
Man oh man... It feels good to go all\xfffeout and still be defeated!
When I think about how you might\xfffeattack, it's like I'm walking on air!
Never give up! To do so is an insult to the\xfffePokémon who fight for you!
I won't forget this battle!\xfffeI'm glad that I could fight against you!
Whatever move you chose, it fills me with the\xfffeheat of battle!
My blood burns with even more fire at\xfffethis age! I've still got some fight in me!
This bitterness that floods me after\xfffea defeat...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe heart that does not succumb to such a\xfffefeeling is filled with energy and life!
Dude...\xfffeYou're really into this, huh!
Awww, dude... I know I'm about done,\xfffebut I'm still just so pumped up!
You totally rocked that!\xfffeYou're raising some wicked Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou got this Trainer thing down!
First impressions are everything!
It's not over yet!\xfffeI'll finish it my way!
I hope for a good ending! I hate endings\xfffethat leave a bitter taste in one's mouth!
Do you ever feel at a loss for words when\xfffesomething greatly moves you?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo tell the truth...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a writer, but right now I'm having\xfffetrouble putting my feelings into words.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou were just that impressive!
Now why would you use that move? If I can\xfffefigure that out, I may be able to win!
A beautiful loss is still a loss,\xfffeand an ugly win is still a win!
Even in a tough situation like this,\xfffethere must be a way to triumph!
Where there's a winner,\xfffethere's also a loser.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's pathetic to make a big deal out\xfffeof losing if you weren't prepared.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you're a true Pokémon battler,\xfffeyou'll reflect upon your loss and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethink about how to win next time!
I can feel it!\xfffeYou and your Pokémon are strong!
This is my final Pokémon!\xfffeIt all comes down to this!
Everything comes down to this next move!\xfffeI'll use the last bit of my strength!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\xfffeor sole best combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why it is difficult\xfffeto keep winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I think a heart that desires\xfffestrength and strives to grow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger is a precious ideal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is why I respect you--\xfffebecause you have these things.
I have a feeling this battle will give my\xfffePokémon a chance to go all out!
I can't believe it's come to this!\xfffeI must have gotten complacent.
Ohhh, that's it! I'll go all out if it'll get\xfffeme a win!
You and your Pokémon are\xfffeboth excellent and elegant.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo have been able to battle against\xfffesuch a splendid team...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon and I learned a lot!\xfffeI offer you my thanks.
It's important to make a good first\xfffeimpression on your opponent!
It's the final chapter!\xfffeHere's my last Pokémon!
I really want a happy ending this time!\xfffeI hate endings that leave a bitter taste.
Wow. I'm stunned.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\xfffehow to say this... Putting my feelings\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto words would just be a trap.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\xfffethan I thought!
I never thought you would use that move...\xfffeNot a bad choice at all.
Those who give up on themselves\xfffecan never claim victory!
There's got to be a way to win...\xfffeEven in the most extreme of conditions!
Which Pokémon should I raise?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhich moves should I teach my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat items should I give my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need to think everything through very\xfffethoroughly if you want to win!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn that sense, you're a very\xfffeimpressive battler!
Oh! Strong as usual.\xfffeThat makes my heart dance!
I may have only one Pokémon remaining,\xfffebut its strength knows no limits!
I'll put everything I have into\xfffethis next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\xfffeor sole best combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why it is difficult\xfffeto keep winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I think a heart that desires\xfffestrength and strives to grow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger is a precious ideal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is why I respect you--\xfffebecause you have these things.
I will show you how harmonious\xfffemy Pokémon and I are!
Battling in extreme conditions\xfffelike this makes me stronger!
I will control my emotions and use them\xfffeas energy to help me obtain victory!
As impressive as always...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo. You and your Pokémon were even\xfffemore elegant and excellent than before!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo have been able to battle against\xfffesuch a splendid team...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon and I learned so much!\xfffeI offer you my thanks.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease battle me again sometime.
This is my path!\xf000븁\x0000
This is everyone's path!
Go forth on your path!
Ai! Ai! Ai!\xfffeHi-yaaah!\xf000븁\x0000
Aww...\xfffeIt was my turn next...
If you like sparring with Pokémon, you've\xfffegot to see Drayden in Opelucid City!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHe's my idol!
Hi-ho!\xf000븁\x0000
Hi-ho...
Once you've reached the top of a peak,\xfffethere's no place to go but down.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLife is full of ups and downs.
Hey there, future Champion!\xf000븁\x0000
Gwahaha! When someone wins, their opponent\xfffehas to lose. Isn't that right?
If there were no Pokémon, we wouldn't\xfffeworry about who's strong or who's weak.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut we also wouldn't have had the chance\xfffeto meet and battle like this, I suppose.
Let's fight!\xf000븁\x0000
You took a win from me!\xfffeArrrgh! It's so frustrating!
I'll use the bitterness of this defeat\xfffeto reach even greater heights!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! There'd be no progress\xfffein the world without loss!
Your Pokémon must be really something if\xfffeyou're here on Route 23!\xf000븁\x0000
Hahaha! Pokémon are so much fun!
It's lots of fun here, 'cause there're\xfffeonly awesome Pokémon. I'm so pumped!
I keep a tally of all of the times that I\xfffehave won or lost up until today.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I battle against you, I wonder which\xfffenumber will be increased.\xf000븁\x0000
So my number of losses went up...
I'm not interested in anything\xfffebut Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt may not be balanced, but I'm satisfied\xfffeliving like this!
This is the concerto I perform with my\xfffemost beloved Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Your side is much more in harmony!
I have been together with Pokémon since\xfffeI was born, and I've battled my\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhole life.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope we're together even at the end\xfffeof all things.
I may be a Backpacker, but I'm also\xfffea Treasure Hunter!\xf000븁\x0000
I missed my chance for that elusive\xfffetreasure called “victory"!
Have you heard of the Magma Stone?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey say it lies in a volcano somewhere\xfffeand has something to do with Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou put it somewhere...or remove it from\xfffesomewhere...and it'll summon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesome Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNo one's that clear on the details.
Let's train!\xfffeWe'll get stronger with our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen we can challenge the Gyms in places\xfffelike Opelucid City and Humilau City!\xf000븁\x0000
Not yet! I still haven't shared my true\xfffestrength with you!
My Pokémon are really, really important\xfffeto me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey've always been by my side to see my\xfffesmiles of joy and tears of frustration!
I'm the Treasure Hunter pretending to be\xfffea Backpacker!\xf000븁\x0000
I missed my chance for that elusive\xfffetreasure called “victory"!

Not yet! I still haven't shared my true\xfffestrength with you!
My Pokémon are like my really important\xfffebrothers and sisters.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEver since I was born, they've been with\xfffeme, sharing my smiles and tears!
Hear the cry of my heart!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“Everyone, SIT DOWN and SHUT UP!"\xf000븁\x0000
Hah... Hah... Hah... I feel a bit better now\xfffethat I've let that out.
I like kids and Pokémon both, but I'm\xfffejust not that nice!
Hey, you!\xfffeYou're gonna lose and cry!\xf000븁\x0000
...Grrr!
That's it! I'm gonna become Champion, and\xfffethen I'll blow you outta the water!
...You look tough.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll right! My Pokémon are burning for\xfffea fight against a tough opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
Arg!\xfffeI wasn't able to give good orders.
What do you think would happen if we had\xfffeour Pokémon fight without any orders?
Ta-da!\xfffeHere's my cute Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh maaan!
...It's OK. My precious Pokémon will\xfffemake me feel better when we get home.
Come on! More!\xfffeBring out your Pokémon's power!
I'm more psyched than I've ever been!\xfffeI can still go on!
So this is what it means to draw forth the\xfffepower hidden in your Pokémon!
I just won a battle back there, so I'm\xfffefeeling good!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whatever!\xfffeI'm in a terrible mood now!
I think I'm gonna go to bed...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm not enough of a man to be able\xfffeto get right back up and try again.
And I was so excited, too...
The pain of my Pokémon...\xfffeI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\xfffemy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\xfffeNo! We can fight on!!
Phew...\xfffeI gave it everything I had, but still...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just couldn't win...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks, though!\xfffeWe're going to keep aiming higher!
Come! Satisfy my urge to battle!
Marvelous! I shall believe in my Pokémon!
If-if I'd believed more, could I have\xfffedrawn out my Pokémon's power?
The bonds between us... Does the fact that\xfffewe can't see them make them more real?
If that is the move you chose\xfffeafter serious consideration, that's fine!
Woooo! Your inexhaustible fighting spirit!\xfffeImpressive!
Good! That strength is good!\xfffeBut I'm going to send it back at you!
After the battle, a fresh wind\xfffeblew through my heart...
Ah... I see...\xfffeThat was quite well thought out.
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\xfffeJust kidding!
Ugh!\xfffeI can't take much more of this...
Phew! I'll at least let my Pokémon take\xfffeit easy on their days off!
To have a chance to battle with such\xfffestrong Pokémon...it was worth the wait!
The world is wide, and the road to glory\xfffeis full of challenges!
Amazing! So that's what a Pokémon\xfffefrom the city is like!
Thanks for playing with me\xfffewhile my parents are busy!
Amazing...\xfffePlease, take me away with you!
What great Pokémon you have!\xfffeThanks so much! I had a great time!
Impressive display!\xfffe...Shall we break for tea?
Ahhh, that was fun!\xfffeBut now I've got to get back to cleaning!
Huhhh?!\xfffeWhat happened, Excadrill?
Huhhh?!\xfffeWhat happened, Hippowdon?
Oh! Plasmaaaa!\xfffeGlory to Team Plasma!
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeWhat a pesky little kid!
The pain of my Pokémon...\xfffeI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\xfffemy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\xfffeNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\xfffeI did my best, but we lost...
The pain of my Pokémon...\xfffeI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\xfffemy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\xfffeNo! We can fight on!!
Phew...\xfffeI gave it everything I had, but still...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just couldn't win...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks, though!\xfffeWe're going to keep aiming higher!
Knave!\xfffeI do ambush thee!\xf000븁\x0000
W-woe is me...
If that be the case then... Farewell!\xfffeForgive me!
Oh-ho-ho!\xfffeYou've been ambushed!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeNo! Plasmaaaa!
Lose! J-just go and lose already!\xfffeA kid like you should definitely lose!
Stupid intruders!\xfffeI'm gonna blast you into space!\xf000븁\x0000
But...aren't I one of Team Plasma's stars?
First Team Galactic fell apart...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen I come all the way to Unova to join\xfffeTeam Plasma, and now you!
What's this? You think you can beat me,\xfffethe one they call queen of Team Plasma?\xf000븁\x0000
Your face...it really drives me mad!
See, I'm going to take over the world and\xfffethen make that idiot N pay!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat traitor...\xfffeJust his face makes me so mad!
If Team Plasma takes over the world,\xfffethere should be fewer Pokémon injured.\xf000븁\x0000
Grr... Tell me! Please!\xfffeJust what is a Pokémon battle?!
Injured Pokémon have both enemies\xfffeand friends!\xf000븁\x0000
Don't you think there will be less war if\xfffeTeam Plasma takes over the world?
Hey there!\xfffeHave you seen any intruders?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWait, you're not...?!\xf000븁\x0000
What an audacious Trainer you are, to waltz\xffferight into our Plasma Frigate!
Tremble in the face of the skill that\xfffemade this Plasma Frigate! Then leave!
You people! Don't get cocky just because\xfffeyou've got Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe've got Pokémon, too!\xfffePokémon that we've stolen from all over!\xf000븁\x0000
What makes your Pokémon so different\xfffefrom mine?
What is this! Who would come after us with\xfffeonly two people?!
You're getting annoyed by the Plasma\xfffeFrigate's gimmicks, aren't you?\xf000븁\x0000
Arghhhh!\xfffeI'm so super annoyed!
We spent so much money on all the Plasma\xfffeFrigate's gimmicks that we've none left!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAll we get to eat every day is bread!
I'm the fighting sweeper!\xfffeI'll clean up garbage like you!\xf000븁\x0000
Oops...
The fact that I let you sneak in here\xfffemeans I'll probably lose my Pokémon, huh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon we stole with that plan two\xfffeyears ago are running out, after all.
I am the one they call the Liepard of\xfffeTeam Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will defeat you without getting a single\xfffescratch on me!\xf000븁\x0000
You are 100 percent perfect intruders!
See, I'm going to take over the world and\xfffethen make that idiot N pay!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat traitor...\xfffeJust his face makes me so mad!
I'm going to go ahead and say it:\xfffePlasmaaaa!!\xf000븁\x0000
Do-over!\xfffeCome on, let me have a do-over!
Pokémon are like our puppets!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey are bound by their Poké Balls and\xfffecontrolled by our orders!
This is our place! We aren't going to\xfffelet anyone mess with it!\xf000븁\x0000
Ahhhh! The floor is covered in mud after all\xfffethat fighting!
There are people who can't live anywhere\xfffebut here! You got a problem with that?!
Come! Satisfy my urge to battle!
Marvelous! I shall believe in my Pokémon!
If-if I'd believed more, could I have drawn\xfffeout my Pokémon's power?
The bonds between us... Does the fact that\xfffewe can't see them make them more real?

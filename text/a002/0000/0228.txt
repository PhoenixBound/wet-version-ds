Bellelba: Tch! This is bad.\xfffeThe world's coming apart.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMy energy must be close to gone, too.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have to consume this\xfffechild's life force soon, or...
Bellelba: Tch! You!\xfffeHow did you get out of the cage?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Plush Toy should have\xfffebeen keeping an eye on you!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Oh! That thing?\xfffeI gave it one little punch,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand it ran away crying...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: H-hey...\xfffeMy reputation!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Shhh...\xfffeDon't talk!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: More importantly,\xfffeI'm going back to my world!
Bellelba: Hm...\xfffeThis could be fun.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, if you can go back,\xfffeyou should go, then.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, look at this.\xfffeIt's the door you came through.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIf you break it, maybe you can go back\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto your own world?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Another door?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if that's the door I came through...\xfffeI might be able to get out if I win!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\xfffeGive it a try!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: OK!\xfffeI'll shatter it for sure!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat's important is...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: ...Strategy!
Bellelba: Ha ha ha!\xfffeWhat does a child with\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeno experience know?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: ...Coolness!
Bellelba: Quit goofing around!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere's no doubt that I'm\xfffeway cooler than you!
Plush Toy: Hey! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xfffeThere are two doors!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd the one you came through\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewas the white door, wasn't it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's true...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: I would wait on defeating\xfffethe white door and focus on\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe black door first.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I see!\xfffeWe have to leave that door\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso we can go back though it!
Bellelba: Oh my...\xfffeWhy are you standing there\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemuttering to yourself?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I was just coming\xfffeup with a plan!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\xfffeTalking to yourself is a sign of trouble.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLonely people talk to themselves, right?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Blast it!\xfffeI'll say it again,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm definitely cooler than you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, come on, I'm a prince!\xfffeI was born into the top rank. My lineage\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand my upbringing were completely different!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was brought up knowing only the best:\xfffemy clothes, my home, and even my meals!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're a completely different grade!
Bellelba: Aaaa!\xfffeThat's enough from you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm a magic queen who got where\xfffeI am through hard work!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOf course I'm more admirable and cooler\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethan some spoiled little prince!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd what's more, if all you get\xfffefrom the fanciest kind of upbringing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis idiots like you, then it's just\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea waste of money!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What did you say?!
Bellelba: Got a problem with it?!
Plush Toy: Sheesh...\xfffeTwo sides of the same coin...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeMan, they're obnoxious...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't even care anymore.\xfffeI'm just a Plush Toy.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeGuess I'll just follow whoever wins...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Hey, Bellelba!\xfffeWhat did you make those doors for anyway?
Bellelba: Well...\xfffeI suppose I could tell you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey're devices to connect the\xfffemagical world to your world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMany people wander into this\xfffeworld through those doors...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I see...\xfffeThen what happens to them?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you lock them up like you did to me?
Bellelba: That's right.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd then their life energy\xfffeis sucked up just by their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeing in this world.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen this life extract is\xfffepoured into me.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What?
Bellelba: The people whose life energy\xfffeis drained forget about trying to escape,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand they follow my every command...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSoon, the balance between the two\xfffeworlds will reverse,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand there will be no one left\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto stand against me... Ha ha ha...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It can't be...\xfffeI never would've imagined those\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedoors would have such terrible power...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Unforgivable!
Bellelba: Whatever.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm free to do whatever\xfffeI choose, am I not?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMore importantly, you should remember\xfffethat your life energy is being drained\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhile you stand here talking to me!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm scared...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee!\xfffeThat's right! Be more afraid!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTremble before me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't, it's no fun for me!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Amazing!
Bellelba: Isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a perfect plan befitting\xfffea magic queen like me!
White Door: Claaaang!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Th-the white door!\xfffeI broke it, but...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee...\xfffeIt looks like you noticed...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat white door was the one\xfffeyou went through to get here.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBreaking it means that...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I can't go back?
Bellelba: Ah ha ha ha! That's right!\xfffeYou can only leave this world from\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe door you came in through.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't even do anything about that rule,\xfffeand I'm the one who made the doors!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's...\xfffeCome on, Plush Toy!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIsn't there anything we can do?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: N-no...\xfffeNot even I can do anything...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat to do...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: S-so,\xfffewe can't leave this place?
Bellelba: Too bad for you,\xfffemy dear Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess I'll just have you work\xfffefor me forever!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: And I got\xfffethis far...
And so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001,\xfffewho'd put everything on the line to escape,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemet a sad fate.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo one knows what happened to\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 after that...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Huff...\xfffePuff... Phew...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: Wh-what's wrong?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: For some\xfffereason, I'm in a lot of pain...
Bellelba: Hee hee hee...\xfffeYou've been in this world too long.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFeeling weak, my dear?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's not it!
Bellelba: Oh, but I'm afraid it is.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnyone who enters this world\xfffehas their power stolen...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's not it!\xfffeThis isn't an issue of strength!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's an issue of how I feel!
Bellelba: What?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Bellelba!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean, Ms. Bellelba!
Bellelba: ...?!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I...\xfffeWhile we were fighting,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI grew to love you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: What?!
Bellelba: What?\xfffeHuh? Ah?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Bellelba!\xfffeI want to live here forever!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo! I want to be with you!\xfffePlease, don't deny my feelings!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBellelba! I love you!
Bellelba: What's this all of a sudden?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst of all, our ages are too far apart...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven though my beauty is overwhelming,\xfffeI'm going to be 108 years old this year.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll be an old lady in a little bit.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I have been thinking about marriage.\xfffeEveryone will be talking about it.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't know if you're my type, either...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: It doesn't matter!\xfffeIf we have love, we'll be fine!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's have a happy life together!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: Man, he's sure not\xfffethinking about the long term...
Bellelba: How bold...\xfffeBut, I don't mind people like that.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFine... Let's start as friends...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's great!\xfffeLet's be happy, Bellelba!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMwa!
Bellelba: Hee hee...
Plush Toy: C-congratulations?
And so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 and\xfffeBellelba were brought together.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTheir love was greater than\xfffethe difference in age,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand they lived happily ever after...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: So strong...\xfffeI don't know if I can do it.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd I've come this far, too...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\xfffeToo bad!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell then! It's back to the\xfffecage for you, then!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis time I'll assign\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemore guards to you!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'm never\xfffegoing to give up!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'll keep running out!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI still have \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 with me!
Bellelba: Oh, sooo scary!\xfffeWell then, I'll just have to take\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecare of your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 for you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith a little magic, it might make\xfffea nice table or chair!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: No way!\xfffeLeave \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 out of this!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\xfffeYou really are a fool.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou always say one word too many\xfffeor get tripped up!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Sniff...\xfffeI should've listened to Father\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand just been good...
And so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001's escape\xfffeattempt came to an end...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo one knows what happened to\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 and \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeafter that...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Do you trap people\xfffein this world and do mean things to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethem because you hate them?
Bellelba: Not really...\xfffeI just want the life energy\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat living things have.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI just use humans as a basic\xfffematerial to extract it from.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: That's terrible...\xfffeUsing people like things...
Bellelba: Oh really.\xfffeLike your father doesn't\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeuse his people?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's what kings do.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You're wrong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFather always spoke very\xfffehighly of the people in the kingdom!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeKings exist for the people!\xfffePeople aren't there for the king!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's completely different from you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, I just now understood the meaning\xfffeof my father's words...
Bellelba: Hm...\xfffeSay whatever you'd like.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Father!\xfffeFather!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I'll do it!
Bellelba: You're still not giving up?\xfffeWell, give it your best shot.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: His name was?
Bellelba: You're an amazingly\xfffedumb prince...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: And Mother!
Bellelba: What is with you?\xfffeMuttering to yourself over there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you even understand the\xfffesituation you're in?
Black Door: Claaaang!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: I did it!\xfffeI defeated the black door!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: All right!
Bellelba: Eeeeeaaaaaugh!\xfffeThat's impossible!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh... Uuugggh...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Wh-what's happening?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: Bellelba put all of her\xfffemagic power into that door.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen the door was broken,\xfffeit hurt her as well.
Bellelba: It hurts...\xfffeThis shouldn't...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehave been...possible...
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Bellelba disappeared!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: That means this world\xfffewill disappear soon, too...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: What should we do?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlush Toy: Open the remaining\xfffewhite door and go inside.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt should connect to the other world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePrince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: OK! Let's go home!\xfffeTo our own world!
...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd so Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 safely\xfffereturned to his own world...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe experiences Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffehad in the magical world\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemade him much more mature.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLater, Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001\xfffebecame the king and reigned\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeover an era of peace and prosperity...
Bellelba: Ah! You're so stubborn!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you just give up already?
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Ummm...
Bellelba: Enough already...\xfffeThey say home is where you hang your hat.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure you'll get used to\xfffeliving in a dark, damp cage!
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: Not yet!
Bellelba: Just give it up already!\xfffeI want to go home and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffetake off my makeup...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you wear it too long,\xfffeit's bad for the condition\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof your skin, you know.
Prince \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001: You give up!
Bellelba: I'm so sorry,\xfffebut I can't do that!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I don't absorb some energy\xfffefrom a young person,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI won't be able to get rid of the wrinkles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeor the bags under my eyes...

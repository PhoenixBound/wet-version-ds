I feel that if it's with you, this battle\xfffewon't be a simple competition\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut a battle where I can ponder\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe relationship between\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon and their Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000
Do you want to show how strong you\xfffeare by winning, or do you want to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelearn what battling really means?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon battles have no meaning if\xfffeyou don't think about why you battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr better said, it makes battling\xfffetogether with Pokémon meaningless.\xf000븁\x0000
Even if hurt, my Pokémon will fight\xfffefor me with just one command.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think you'll value and trust\xfffeyour Pokémon more if you keep\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat fact close to your heart.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat can I do for these Pokémon?\xfffeWhat should I do?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! I battle with everything\xfffeI have to find the ideal relationship\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebetween Pokémon and people!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel like I saw a little of\xfffethe way toward my ideals.\xf000븁\x0000
Even when you lose, your Pokémon\xfffeare still brimming with fighting spirit.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'll keep battling many Trainers\xfffeand Pokémon like this, and if I can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelearn what kind of person I am, it will\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeopen up my path.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure this path will lead me to become\xfffethe person I'm meant to be.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon will always be with you and me as\xfffewe go down our own paths.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOur important friends, Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Pokémon are by all of our sides--\xfffemine, yours, and each and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeevery Trainer's!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why we move forward!\xfffeThe Pokémon walking alongside us\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegive us the strength to do so!\xf000븁\x0000
In this corner, the young Pokémon\xfffeTrainer battling for his ideals, Cheren!\xf000븁\x0000

By battling many Trainers, you should\xfffelearn many things.\xf000븁\x0000
I apply what I learned at the Pokémon\xfffeTrainer's School in battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you kindly demonstrate how you\xfffebattle and with which Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000

So you wanted to challenge me?\xfffeLet me see what you're made of!\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon battles are similar to how\xfffewaves come in and out!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to see if you're the kind\xfffeof Trainer who can read that motion!\xf000븁\x0000
I've been churned in the rough waves,\xfffeand I've grown tough in a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepitch-black cave!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you wanted to challenge me?\xfffeLet me see what you're made of!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa, wow! You made a much bigger\xfffesplash than I expected!\xf000븁\x0000
All right!\xfffeI rode the big wave!\xf000븁\x0000
Brawly: Someday your talent\xfffewill become a big wave,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecreating a storm of surprise\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeamong Pokémon Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000
Brawly: The one making a big wave is me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm going to keep on riding that wave!\xf000븁\x0000
It's Brawly, a big wave in fighting!\xfffeStir up a new wave!\xf000븁\x0000

The cheerfully electrifying man,\xfffeWattson! Wahahahahahahahaaa!\xf000븁\x0000

With skills inherited from my grandfather,\xfffewho was once one of the Elite Four,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm going to demonstrate the\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehot moves I honed close to a volcano!\xf000븁\x0000
The way to get the most out of the\xfffestrength you and your Pokémon have\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeacquired is to not push too hard and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffejust be yourself!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, I'll show you how to do that\xffferight now, OK?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh...\xfffeI guess I was trying too hard...\xf000븁\x0000
I... I won!\xfffeI guess my well-honed moves worked!\xf000븁\x0000
Flannery: Your strength sure\xfffereminds me of someone...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou must have battled with many\xfffedifferent people and learned good\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethings from them every time, huh?\xf000븁\x0000
Flannery: My Pokémon were able to make\xfffethe most of their power when I did things\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemy way!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaybe I've matured a little bit!\xf000븁\x0000
It's the one with a fiery passion\xfffethat burns, Flannery! Burn, baby, burn!\xf000븁\x0000
I will do everything in my power as\xfffea Trainer to win.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou'd better give it your best shot, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I moved from Olivine City to\xfffePetalburg City and became stronger...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll use all of that strength now!\xfffeYou'd better give it your best shot, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost to my own child...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI rethought everything about myself,\xfffeso now there is no way I can lose!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll do everything in my power to win!\xfffeYou'd better give it your best shot, too!\xf000븁\x0000
...\xfffeI... I can't...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't believe it.\xfffeI lost to you?\xf000븁\x0000
We both gave everything we had.\xfffeThat was a wonderful match.\xf000븁\x0000
Norman: I'm going to redouble my\xfffetraining by taking on this tournament!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt would bother me as a Trainer to\xfffenot avenge my loss to you!\xf000븁\x0000
Norman: This time, my victory\xfffewas a matter of luck.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have to continue to pursue strength\xfffeand be able to win anytime!\xf000븁\x0000
A man in pursuit of power, Norman!\xfffeShow us that strength!\xf000븁\x0000
Witness the elegant choreography\xfffeof my Pokémon and I!\xf000븁\x0000

A Trainer that commands Pokémon\xfffewith more grace than I...\xf000븁\x0000
Our elegant dance is finished!\xf000븁\x0000
Winona: Though I fell to you, I will remain\xfffedevoted to bird Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Winona: I won, but I see you are\xfffeone with your Pokémon as well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe should have our Pokémon battle\xfffeeach other again someday!\xf000븁\x0000

Tate: It looks like the bond between\xfffeyou and your Pokémon was far\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger than mine...\xf000븁\x0000
Tate: Actually, I'm a twin!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen I'm with my sister,\xfffeI'm even stronger!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI mean we can finish\xfffeeach other's thoughts!\xf000븁\x0000

At last, the final...\xfffeI've captured your essence.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I focus and battle,\xfffeI won't lose!\xf000븁\x0000
Before I knew it, my pace was set\xfffeby you...\xf000븁\x0000
The place where you were struggling\xfffejust now. That is my world!\xf000븁\x0000
Rylan: I lost when I lost\xfffesight of my battle...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat was I doing...?\xf000븁\x0000
Rylan: Only people who stick\xfffeto their own way will win...\xf000븁\x0000
He's doing it his own way!\xfffeMy way, Rylan! Come on in!\xf000븁\x0000

That was a great Pokémon battle.\xfffeBut...I'm disappointed by myself.\xf000븁\x0000
It was a great battle!\xfffeAre your Pokémon OK and not hurt?\xf000븁\x0000
Destiny: I'm frustrated, but...\xfffeIt's polite to praise the winner!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Thank you very much!\xf000븁\x0000
Destiny: Thank you very much!\xfffeLet's have a battle again!\xf000븁\x0000
She begins and ends a battle with\xffferespect. A very polite fighter, Destiny!\xf000븁\x0000
I feel that if it's with you, this battle\xfffewon't be a simple competition\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut a battle where I can ponder\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe relationship between\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon and their Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000
Do you want to show how strong you\xfffeare by winning, or do you want to\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelearn what battling really means?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon battles have no meaning if\xfffeyou don't think about why you battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr better said, it makes battling\xfffetogether with Pokémon meaningless.\xf000븁\x0000
Even if hurt, my Pokémon will fight\xfffefor me with just one command.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think you'll value and trust\xfffeyour Pokémon more if you keep\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat fact close to your heart.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat can I do for these Pokémon?\xfffeWhat should I do?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! I battle with everything\xfffeI have to find the ideal relationship\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebetween Pokémon and people!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel like I saw a little of\xfffethe way toward my ideals.\xf000븁\x0000
Even when you lose, your Pokémon\xfffeare still brimming with fighting spirit.\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: I'll keep battling many Trainers\xfffeand Pokémon like this, and if I can\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelearn what kind of person I am, it will\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeopen up my path.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm sure this path will lead me to become\xfffethe person I'm meant to be.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon will always be with you and me as\xfffewe go down our own paths.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOur important friends, Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Pokémon are by all of our sides--\xfffemine, yours, and each and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeevery Trainer's!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why we move forward!\xfffeThe Pokémon walking alongside us\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegive us the strength to do so!\xf000븁\x0000

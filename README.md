What are you doing here? Shoo! There's nothing to see here yet besides **spoilers**!

## Rom hashes

This hack is being made using a White 2 (US) game, padded to 512 MiB because why not. If you're in the future and your hash doesn't match, it's either a different size or region, or you've got a cool cartridge dumper that can read DS cartridges' "Secure Area" that doesn't exist right now.  
MD5: 0AFC7974C393265D8CF23379BE232A1C  
SHA-256: 3E50AEC3DB401332175A5D2B5FE2A68AC1A05EC63995DBA9D1506B1B51837446

Until the contents of Black 2's files can be confirmed, there are no promises that this hack will be compatible with Black 2 (US).
